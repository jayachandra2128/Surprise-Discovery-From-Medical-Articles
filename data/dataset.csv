bread perhaps one widely used types food planet it also food poses health risk people diabetes despite risk bread one hardest foods give up fortunately breads market raise blood sugar extreme levels wholegrain breads highfiber ingredients like oats bran may best option people diabetes making bread home specific diabetesfriendly ingredients may also help reduce impact bread blood sugar levels diabetes two main types type 1 type 2 people type 1 diabetes difficulty producing insulin hormone captures blood sugar or glucose transfers cells glucose preferred energy source cells type 2 diabetes common form diabetes this type diabetes also easier form prevent manage lifestyle changes medication according world health organization 422 million people type 2 diabetes worldwide in earlier phase type 2 diabetes pancreas produce insulin cells become insensitive effects this sometimes due poor diet genetics lifestyle habits because this cells cant access blood sugar following meal nutrition plays crucial role diabetes control its putting proper dietary planning practice good blood sugar management accomplished a good diet must also combined lifestyle changes medication a carbohydrate one three major nutrients essential human health however carbohydrates also raise blood sugar reduce effective diabetes control this mainly carbohydrates break blood sugar the key keeping blood sugar check following meal choose food items contain quality carbohydrates quality carbohydrates rate low medium glycemic index the glycemic index measurement individual foods effects blood sugar there three basic categories glycemic index low medium high lowglycemic foods contain little carbohydrates these include mediumglycemic foods include highglycemic foods include for people want make diabetesfriendly bread using standard bread recipe ingredients added mix lower glycemic index final product highfiber highprotein highfat ingredients may important additions reduce impact bread blood sugar these ingredients include things like bakers usually want replace onefourth regular flour equal proportion other healthier ingredients for example favorite bread recipe calls 2 cups flour half cup flour replaced half cup flaxseed meal swapping allwhite flour wholewheat pastry flour also good idea once bread baked glycemic index reduced further people spread healthy fats like avocado flaxseed oil replace mayonnaise sugary highglycemic spreads commercial bread found grocery stores usually made white flour refined white flour absent fiber send blood sugar skyrocketing even bread marketed wheat bread may made refined wheat whole grain some brands identify bread seven grain nine grain use grains crust majority bread still made refined white flour its deceptive form advertising lead many people diabetes choose wrong bread health concerns here four types breads that along overall healthy lifestyle may healthier options diabetes control fiber type carbohydrate body cant digest it keeps bowels regular assists promoting feeling fullness fiber also significant nutrient helps control blood sugar studies shown soluble fiber slow rate digestion reduce rise blood sugar eating this fiber said lower glycemic index food breads soluble fiber added may helpful way manage blood sugar via diet people keep mind fiberenriched wholegrain breads still relatively high carbohydrates eating products moderation important while high carbohydrates multigrain bread typically made whole unrefined grains these grains generally high naturally occurring fiber not enriched important ingredient lessening impact carbohydrates blood sugar when choosing wholegrain bread people find one includes ingredients like oats quinoa buckwheat wholegrain wheat brown rice bran barley in addition lower glycemic index compared wheat flour many whole grains offer number nutrients like zinc vitamin e protein sandwich bread option tortillas provide tasty versatile sometimes healthier choice sandwiches as diabetes epidemic continues escalate worldwide companies pushing wider range lowcarbohydrate tortillas appeal healthconscious consumers many lowcarbohydrate tortillas available market added fiber reduce carbohydrate count some tortillas simply made lowcarbohydrate ingredients like whey soy protein powders people use lowcarbohydrate tortillas would use bread wrapping favorite sandwich ingredients tortilla tortillas also used mini pizzas homemade burritos tacos perhaps best choice diabetesfriendly bread one made without flour grains while flourless sproutedgrain breads available good source fiber still rich carbohydrates grainfree breads made ingredients like almond flour coconut flour flaxseed meal found specialty health food stores check nutrition facts since may also higher calories there also many recipes making grainfree bread internet a search term like grainfree bread recipe bring lowcarbohydrate bread recipes these breads tend expensive make purchase often yield smaller amount compared traditional bread recipes however unless specified doctor dietitian patients diabetes necessarily need eliminate bread bread products diet using lowcarbohydrate multigrain wholegrain bread options may best bet keeping bread diet without posing great health risk continuing exercise program using doctorprescribed medications consuming mostly lowglycemic foods

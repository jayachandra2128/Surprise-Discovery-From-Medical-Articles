research university college london ucl scientists could lead development effective drugs treating manic depression thanks new screening approach developed slime mould microbe lives leaves dung forest floors the breakthrough using slime mould dictyostelium first possible alternative current accidental method discovering manic depression drugs the findings published today may 2005 issue molecular pharmacology this research carried team led dr robin williams ucl department biology describes team tested variants current drugs market slime mould it represents first step towards development scientific system testing new treatments manic depression manic depression drugs market today always found serendipitously says dr williams lithium originally proposed treatment gout late 1800s chance later found helped balance moods widely used manic depression drug market valproic acid another drug commonly used treat epilepsy manic depression also found accidentally initially used solvent dissolving epilepsy drugs with results identify new compounds hope effect manic depression treatments without unwanted side effects we testing using simple microbe slime mould much faster easier reliable use human nerve cells current manic depression drugs like valproic acid sideeffects increased chance liver damage increase chance birth defects embryonic malformations taken mothers first trimester pregnancy may increase hiv infection however developing alternative manic depression drugs far proved impossible the scientists hope screening system involves testing possible drugs slime mould looking chemical change provide important scientific building block could lead better safer range manic depression drugs the team currently developing variants valproic acid expect fewer harmful sideeffects the origins dr williams work field set nature 2002 found protein may involved causing manic depression called prolyl oligopeptidase this protein present slime mould mammalian nervous system according number teams protein functions abnormally manic depressed patients the team went discover common way bipolar drugs work ability deplete chemical inositol trisphosphate found nervous system this common effect caused three different drugs core manic depressive drugs work team used discovery develop system testing new manic depression drugs using system team found two possible alternatives current drugs market lithium valproic acid carbamazepine the novel drugs based valproic acid they still work deplete chemical inositol trisphosphate team eliminated harmful side effects initial tests slime mould later confirmed animal nervous system ready extended comprehensive trials the team first group scientists working field use slime mould design better manic depression drugs dr williams said testing new drugs slime mould possible cells function similar way human slime mould if drug acts basic part cells function by example inhibiting enzyme inhibit enzyme human slime mould cells working slime mould faster easier reliable complicated mammalian nerve cell although system predict precisely new drugs impact people brain complex single cell made first step identifying new manic depression drugs previously impossible this gives us basis believing new drugs could useful would warrant testing testing drug slime mould initially acts reliable guide scientists first time

we see fierce protection offspring many animals says stephen gammie university wisconsinmadison assistant professor zoology lead author recent paper there stories cats rescuing kittens burning buildings birds swooping people chicks ground in terms biology makes sense mothers would lay lives protect offspring especially means parents genes passed next generation says gammie but adds despite observations theories explaining mothers display behavior commonly known maternal aggression little research investigated biological mechanisms turn trait new mothers weve known long time fear anxiety decrease lactation explains gammie maybe its decrease allows mothers attack situation normally would evoke fear response testing hypothesis wisconsin professor colleagues studied link maternal aggression mice levels corticotropinreleasing hormone crh peptide acts brain control behavior about six days group mice gave birth new mothers received injections containing either one three doses crh saline solution amount peptide following injection given day four consecutive days researchers returned mother mice pups twentyeight minutes later researchers removed pups introduced male intruder under normal conditions female rodents fiercely attack males says gammie noting males sometimes eat pups the best defense mom offense for study mice received either dose low dose peptide displayed expected behavior as levels crh increased number attacks duration dramatically decreased the results show example mice lowest levels crh attacked 20 times duration 45 seconds mice moderate levels peptide attacked six times eight seconds mice highest levels crh didnt attack all when put male cage moms would sit there they werent protective all if anything skittish they showed fear response says gammie the researchers note altering levels peptide appeared affect maternal aggression normal maternal behaviors nursing observed mothers encounters male mice based results gammie says low crh levels appear necessary part maternal aggression if dont keep low wont see fiercely protective behavior he adds finding first evidence suggesting biological mechanism enables parents regardless potential danger defend offspring may also begin explain mothers occasionally neglect harm offspring postpartum depression individuals linked higher levels crh release overly active stress response explains gammie if crh needs low see maternal protection offspring work suggests explains moms high postpartum depression high crh may neglect also may abuse children written emily carlson 6082629772

2012 ahead summer olympic games the study authors caution little progress tackling global pandemic physical activity since 2012 olympics quarter adults worldwide failing meet physical activity recommendations in analysis researchers posed question does exercise reduce eradicate harmful effects including increased risk early death associated prolonged sitting health risks linked physical inactivity include increased risk heart disease stroke type 2 diabetes cancers recent estimates suggesting 5 million people die year globally due failing meet daily activity levels findings second part series worldfirst study estimate economic burden physical inactivity worldwide shows globally healthcare expenditure lost productivity physical inactivity cost world 67 billion 2013 physical inactivity recognized global pandemic leads diseases early deaths imposes major burden economy says dr melody ding senior research fellow the university sydneys school public health australia dr ding notes action taken improve population levels physical inactivity economic burden physical inactivity projected increase globally predominantly low middleincome countries the world health organization who recommend adults aged 1864 least 150 minutes moderateintensity aerobic physical activity throughout week in first paper series researchers analyzed 16 studies included data 1 million people the team formed four groups individuals based level moderateintensity exercise ranging 575 minutes per day moderateintensity exercise defined walking 35 miles per hour cycling 10 miles per hour results study show people spend 8 hours day sitting physically active significantly lower risk death people spend fewer hours sitting physically active moreover increased risk death associated spending 8 hours sitting eliminated 1 hour physical activity per day people greatest risk death individuals sat prolonged periods mostly inactive they 2859 percent likely die early compared active group similar risk associated smoking obesity the study finds around 25 percent participants hour exercise per day there lot concern health risks associated todays sedentary lifestyles says prof ulf ekelund norwegian school sports sciences norway medical research council epidemiology unit university cambridge united kingdom our message positive one possible reduce even eliminate risks active enough even without take sports go gym prof ulf ekelund for many people commute work officebased jobs way escape sitting prolonged periods time for people particular cannot stress enough importance getting exercise whether getting walk lunchtime going run morning cycling work an hour physical activity per day ideal unmanageable least exercise day help reduce risk adds also observed study time spent watching tv per day particular type sedentary behavior subgroup approximately half million people watching tv 3 hours per day associated increased risk death activity groups except among active the authors say association could long hours watching tv may marker unhealthy lifestyle general including less likely take exercise in third paper series looking progress challenges physical activity since 2012 olympics prof jim sallis university californiasan diego says the global pandemic physical inactivity remains global response far slow the fourth final paper highlights need collaboration schools transport sports recreation environmental sectors increase levels physical activity monitor physical inactivity risk factor negative health impacts largescale problems require largescale solutions need commitment governments well international organizations tackle global public health challenge physical inactivity science practice providing important evidence time action says prof rodrigo reis washington university st louis mo dr pam das senior executive editor dr richard horton editorinchief the lancet say linked comment the world needs get serious physical activity and means

prevention cdc everyone united states aged 6 months older vaccinated flu virus every year flu vaccination particularly important children age 5 years adults aged 65 older pregnant women these groups greatest risk flurelated complications now new study highlights importance flu vaccination expectant mothers the study found babies mothers receive shot pregnancy much less likely develop flu first 6 months life babies cannot immunized first 6 months must rely others protection flu time notes lead author julie h shakib assistant professor pediatrics university utah school medicine when pregnant women get flu vaccine clear benefits infants to reach findings shakib colleagues analyzed health records 245000 pregnant women offspring totaled 249000 infants including twins triplets even larger multiple births the researchers looked health records nine flu seasons december 2005 march 2014 around 10 percent women reported getting flu shot pregnancy remaining 90 percent vaccinated over nine flu seasons laboratoryconfirmed flu confirmed among 658 infants aged 6 months younger of cases 638 97 percent occurred among infants whose mothers received flu vaccination pregnancy a total 151 infants laboratoryconfirmed flu hospitalized researchers report 148 infants born mothers vaccinated flu pregnancy the researchers calculated flu vaccination pregnancy reduced risk laboratoryconfirmed flu 70 percent risk flurelated hospitalization 80 percent infants aged 6 months younger on analyzing health records incidence respiratory syncytial virus rsv respiratory infection common winter months team found flu shot pregnancy impact rsv incidence among infants the researchers say finding suggests lower risk flu among infants whose mothers vaccinated pregnancy result vaccine itself senior study author dr carrie l byington professor pediatrics university utah school medicine notes flu vaccination rates among expectant mothers increased 20092010 swine flu h1n1 pandemic however says rates still low representing public health issue about 50 percent pregnant women reported immunized latest flu season says dr byington but need get number much closer 100 percent the researchers stress pregnant women offspring increased risk flurelated complications highlighting importance immunization pregnant women highrisk group influenza season influenza outbreaks receive vaccinations if caregivers offer influenza vaccinations i would encourage pregnant women ask it study coauthor dr michael w varner university utah school medicine study coauthor dr michael w varner university utah school medicine

genetic variations associated risk factors diseases heart disease diabetes reported nature genetics research shows large scale genomic datasets used help identify potential novel biological targets studying cardiovascular diseases genetics implicated cardiovascular blood diseases time however complex diseases extremely difficult find specific genetic causes in study scientists studied genomes almost 36000 healthy people european ancestry looking rare genetic links 20 known risk factors disease raised levels cholesterol haemoglobin blood two previous largescale projects provided whole genome sequences needed uk10k project study genetic code 10000 people aims better understand links rare genetic variations disease 1000 genome project from data scientists created resource called dense imputation panel freely accessible scientific community the panel holds much detail fill gaps impute data missing lower resolution genetic studies the level detail imputation panel provides enabled scientists look specific disease risk factors find 17 new genetic variants of these 16 would extremely difficult find without imputation panel data professor nicole soranzo joint senior author sanger institute said the dense imputation panel used study allowed us search genetic variations much less frequent ever before individually explain greater genetic risk as efforts continue characterise genetic underpinnings complex diseases methods developed study expected enable next wave discoveries causes diseases might develop new treatments dr valentina iotchkova first author sanger institute european bioinformatics institute said this first stage discovery process going tell us contribution genetics makes complex human diseases we looked genome 17 new variants lie see could tell us biology changes make body could make person less susceptible disease the researchers applied analytical technique called finemapping study hundreds regions human genome contain genetic risk factors cardiometabolic disease for 59 regions able narrow likely genetic causes small sets genetic variants combining fine mapping technique biological data drilled even provided additional functional insight underlying biology dr paul auer joint senior author paper university wisconsinmilwaukee our study provides refined method use panel alongside analysis techniques find rare variants contribute complex genetic conditions like heart disease diabetes we also narrowed set potentially causal variants small set variants follow up we focused cardiometabolic traits panel covers entire

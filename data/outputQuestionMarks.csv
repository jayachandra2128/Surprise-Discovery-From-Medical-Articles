While  Parkinson's disease  typically brings to mind symptoms such as tremors and slow movement, researchers have found that nearly half of all Parkinson's patients also suffer from  depression . While it might seem natural that someone who has a disease such as Parkinson's might become depressed, it's not so simple, says neurologist Irene Richard, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical Center.    
""Many patients assume that's it's normal to feel this way. They might say, 'If you had Parkinson's disease, you'd feel this way too.' That's not true. If you treat the depression, they'll still have the other symptoms of the disease, but they feel better. It's one aspect of the disease that may be very treatable,"" says Richard.    

""People diagnosed with other serious diseases that may also be disabling, such as  rheumatoid arthritis , aren't nearly as likely to become depressed.""    

Richard and co-author William McDonald, M.D., a psychiatrist at Emory University, discussed the links between depression and movement disorders like Parkinson's disease in a review article in the August 24 issue of the journal Neurology. In an article titled, ""Can 'blue' genes affect mood and movement?"" the two noted that a team from Columbia University has linked a gene known to cause a movement disorder known as  dystonia  with a type of early-onset depression. Now they and other physicians around the country are exploring possible links between mood and movement in other disorders such as Parkinson's disease.    

Of Parkinson's patients who become depressed, about half have ""major"" depression that has a significant impact on their lives, while others have milder forms of depression that are still distressing. 
   
""There's a huge amount of suffering out there due to the depression that comes so frequently as part of Parkinson's disease,"" says Richard, who is an expert on the psychiatric aspects of the disease. Patients who have lost the pleasure they once took in activities or hobbies, or who are having difficulty sleeping or have a poor appetite, have common symptoms of depression. 
   
""The depression is part of the illness, not simply a reaction to the disease. We've found that if a physician brings up the topic, patients will be honest and will discuss their depression, but oftentimes they won't bring it up themselves. But depression is the number-one factor responsible for poor quality of life among these patients. We need to educate physicians to ask about this in their patients with Parkinson's disease,"" says Richard, an associate professor of Neurology and Psychiatry. 
   
Doctors estimate that about 1 million people in North America have Parkinson's disease, which targets a small group of cells in a part of the brain known as the substantia nigra that produce a chemical called dopamine. The loss of these brain cells results in abnormal signals to other parts of the brain, which Richard says appears to influence a person's mood. In addition, the disease also affects cells that produce brain chemicals such as  serotonin  and norepinephrine, which can play a role in depression.    

Richard and McDonald are leading a national research study to test the effectiveness of anti-depressants in treating some of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The study will evaluate common anti-depressant medications paroxetine (brand name Paxil) and venlafaxine (brand name Effexor) at treating the depression that patients experience. Richard says that until now, there hasn't been a large placebo-controlled study to see how well anti-depressant medications actually work in patients with Parkinson's. The disease wreaks havoc in the brain and may cause such medications to work differently than they do in healthy people.    

The study will include 228 patients at 15 sites around the nation. The four-year, $4 million study is being funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

Research by University College London (UCL) scientists could lead to the development  of more effective drugs for 

treating manic  depression   thanks to a new screening approach developed in a ?slime mould' - a microbe that lives in leaves 

and dung on forest floors. The breakthrough using slime mould (Dictyostelium) is the first possible alternative to the 

current - accidental - method of discovering manic depression drugs. The findings are published today in the May 2005 issue 

of Molecular Pharmacology.    
 
This research, carried out by a team led by Dr Robin Williams of the UCL Department of Biology, describes how the team tested 

variants of current drugs on the market in slime mould. It represents a first step towards the development of a scientific 

system for testing new treatments for manic depression. ?Manic depression drugs on the market today have always been found 

serendipitously,? says Dr Williams. ?Lithium was originally proposed as a treatment for  gout  in the late 1800s and by chance, 

it was later found that it helped balance moods and is now the most widely used manic depression drug on the market. Valproic 

acid, another drug commonly used to treat both  epilepsy  and manic depression, was also found accidentally, as it was 

initially used as a solvent for dissolving epilepsy drugs.    
 
?With these results, we can now identify new compounds which we hope will have the same effect as other manic depression 

treatments without unwanted side effects. We are testing this using a simple microbe - a slime mould - which is much faster, 

easier and more reliable to use than human nerve cells.?    
 
Current manic depression drugs like valproic acid have side-effects - an increased chance of liver damage, an increase in the 

chance of birth defects (embryonic malformations) if taken by mothers during the first trimester of pregnancy and may 

increase  HIV  infection. However, developing alternative manic depression drugs has so far proved impossible.    
The scientists hope that their screening system, which involves testing possible drugs in slime mould and looking for a 

chemical change, will provide an important scientific building block that could lead to a better and safer range of manic 

depression drugs. The team is currently developing variants of valproic acid that they expect will have fewer harmful 

side-effects.    
The origins of Dr Williams' work in this field were set out in Nature in 2002, when he found a protein which may be involved 

in causing manic depression, called prolyl oligopeptidase. This protein is present in both slime mould and the mammalian 

nervous system - and according to a number of teams the protein functions abnormally in manic depressed patients.  

The team went on to discover that the common way that all bipolar drugs work is by their ability to deplete the chemical 

inositol trisphosphate, found in the nervous system. This common effect caused by three very different drugs is the core of 

how manic depressive drugs work and the team has now used this discovery to develop a system for testing new manic depression 

drugs. Using this system, the team has found two possible alternatives to the current drugs on the market lithium, valproic 

acid and carbamazepine. The novel drugs are based on valproic acid. They still work to deplete the chemical inositol 

trisphosphate but the team has eliminated harmful side effects. Initial tests on slime mould were later confirmed in the 

animal nervous system and are now ready to be extended to comprehensive trials. The team is the first group of scientists 

working in this field to use a slime mould to design better manic depression drugs.    
 
Dr Williams said: ?Testing new drugs on slime mould is possible because cells function in a very similar way, be they from a 

human or from a slime mould. If a drug acts on a basic part of a cell's function by, for example, inhibiting an enzyme, it 

should inhibit that enzyme in both human and slime mould cells. Working in slime mould is faster, easier and more reliable 

than the more complicated mammalian nerve cell.    
 
?Although our system does not predict precisely how new drugs will impact on people - after all the brain is more complex 

than a single cell - we have made the first step in identifying new manic depression drugs and this has previously been 

impossible. This gives us some basis for believing that these new drugs could be useful and would warrant further testing. 

Testing the drug on slime mould initially acts as a reliable guide for scientists so for the first time we can screen drugs 

and identify better treatments for manic depression.?

A dietary supplement of  vitamins  and minerals may help to slash the risk of  cancer , research has found.    
The supplement contained the same levels of  antioxidant  nutrients found in a diet rich in fruit and vegetables. 
   
Antioxidants help to mop up highly reactive molecules called free radicals which can cause damage to the body's tissues. 
   
Researchers say their work - the SuViMax study - provides compelling evidence of the importance of a healthy diet. 
   
Scientists in France gave the supplement to thousands of men and women over a seven year period, and found cancer rates were cut by almost a third. 
   
A total of 13,000 men and women aged 35 to 60 took part in the study. 
   
Half were given a daily supplement containing 6mg of  beta-carotene , 120mg of vitamin C, 90mg of vitamin E, 100 micrograms of  selenium , and 20 milligrams of zinc. 
   
A dummy capsule was given to the other participants. 
   
Over a seven-and-a-half year follow-up period, 103 men and 71 women died. 
   
Effect on men 
   
Cancer, which affected 562 volunteers, was the major cause of death while  heart disease  afflicted 271. 
   
In total, 56 men and 47 women died from various kinds of cancer while heart disease claimed the lives of 28 men and five women. 
   
Taking the supplement had no effect on heart disease, and did not influence cancer rates in women. 
   
But the scientists said a 31% reduction in the risk of all cancers was seen in men taking the antioxidants. 
   
And, overall, the death rate was 37% lower among men who took the supplement. 
   
The researchers, led by Dr Serge Hercberg, from the Scientific and Technical Institute for Nutrition and Diet in Paris, said further studies would be needed to confirm the findings. 
   
But they add: 'Even now, however, they completely support recommendations for following a healthy diet, particularly one rich in fruit and vegetables which are major dietary sources of antioxidant vitamins and minerals, for all ages in life and for both sexes.' 
   
The researchers said women may not have received the same benefits because their diet were better than those of men. 
   
They believe that both sexes may benefit if the research was carried out in the UK, where poor diet is more widespread. 
   
An Oxford University study a year ago which looked at vitamins C, E and beta-carotene concluded that they were a waste of money. 
   
This was followed by a Food Standards Agency report warning that overdosing on vitamins and minerals could be harmful. 
   
The French scientists agreed that vitamins and minerals were better obtained from fruit and vegetables. 
   
They wrote: 'There is reason to believe that the effect would be less than that of dietary sources of antioxidants, particularly fruit and vegetables, which provide other protective substances.' ",0

Heavy smokers ? those who light up 25 times or more a day ? look to their cigarettes for comfort and companionship, according to a new study. 
   In-depth interviews with 51 heavy smokers in the journal Nicotine & Tobacco Research uncovered both anger and fear at the thought of quitting, say Beti Thompson, Ph.D., and colleagues of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
   
?Over 90 percent believed that even though smoking was dangerous, it was their ?friend.? The danger of losing a friend was more threatening to them than the dangers of smoking, and they worried about what would take the place of cigarettes emotionally,? Thompson says.
   
?Although heavy smokers know they need to stop smoking, they feel angry that this source of physical pleasure should be taken from them. They see themselves as victims who have been duped into smoking and continued smoking,? she adds.
   
Thompson and colleagues interviewed the smokers to find out what kinds of psychological traits might be linked with heavy smoking and the ability to quit. Most of the study participants were white men, ages 35 to 54, who had been smoking for nearly 25 years.
   
Nearly two-thirds of the participants said they were physically addicted to cigarettes. More than half said they smoked to relieve  stress  and anger or to keep people away. 
   
?For many of these participants, any threat to their world ? a scolding from their boss, an argument with a spouse ? was sufficient to drive them back to smoking as a way to cope and feel better,? Thompson says.
   
Many of the smokers had tried to quit on multiple occasions, but said social pressures, including friends and family who smoke, kept them from successfully quitting. The participants also feared withdrawal symptoms, weight gain and the loss of physical pleasure from giving up cigarettes.
   
The study was supported by the National Cancer Institute.

According to a reputable researcher, 70% of  colon cancers  are preventable if we changed our diets a bit.    
According to current research, there are several things you could do.  Researchers say that future research will tell us which of the inter-related strategies (in your diet plan) would be the best for your particular needs.    
One factor most experts agree about is  insulin resistance .  As the body becomes less responsive to  insulin , it produces more (insulin) to make up for this.    
High insulin levels along with related growth factors trigger changes in cell processes in ways that aid the development of  cancers .    
Inactive and overweight people (apple shaped people this big waists) are more likely to develop colon cancer.  Inactive and overweight people tend to be more insulin resistant, and hence have higher levels of insulin in their bodies.    
According to new studies, if you consume lots of saturated fats and refined  carbohydrates  (sugars and refined grains) you are increasing your risk of getting colon cancers (because of the effect you will be having on your insulin levels, among other things).    

The National Cancer Institute (USA) advises people to take more exercise.  Exercise, as well as having the obvious benefits we all know about, also stops your insulin levels from going up (keeps them down).    
The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) advises people to take an hour of moderate exercise each day.    
Consuming enough  calcium  is the latest strategy to lower colon cancer risk. A recent study looked at the recurrence of colon polyps, which are noncancerous growths that can turn into cancer. Polyp recurrence was 29 percent lower with a higher consumption of calcium and  vitamin D .    
Research presented at AICR?s most recent research conference suggested that calcium might be especially important for those with a high-fat diet. By binding fatty acids and bile acids ? both of which promote cancer ? in our digestive tract, calcium may protect the colon. ",3

Cancer specialist, Julian Peto, says that fat children should go on the  atkins  diet so that they lose weight and do not get illnesses.  Prof. J Peto is from the Institute of Cancer Research (UK).    
He says that kids who cannot lose weight would benefit from a high-protein, low-carb diet.  He says this diet suppresses the appetite of these children and keeps them from getting fat again.    
Professor Peto warned that  obesity  is overtaking smoking as the UK?s number one preventable killer.  He says we need to tackle obesity early.    
He says that the current dietary advice is not working.  Children are just getting fatter and fatter.  He reckons children should have their weight checked at regular intervals at school.    
In the UK, as in the USA and many other countries, child obesity is soaring, he says.    
In 1998 9% of British four-year-olds were obese.  In 1988 the figure was half that amount.    
Being overweight increases a person?s risk of developing  diabetes ,  heart disease  and some  cancers .    
The Atkins diet involves eating lots of protein foods, while at the same time consuming much fewer  carbohydrates .  People who eat in this way tend to eat less because proteins with low carbs make you less hungry.    
It is all to do with  insulin .  If you eat loads of carbs in one session your insulin levels rise too high.  High insulin levels tells the body and brain to do lots of things, some of which are not ideal.  High insulin levels tells the brain ?do not use stored fat?.  This means that a couple of hours after your high carb meal your body has two choices, either get that low sugar feeling ( tiredness ) or eat some more food ? and the carb binge cycle perpetuates.    
Professor Peto does not think high salt and fat are ideal.  But he recognises that the Atkins diet gives obese people a better chance of living a healthier life than they were having before than anything else currently available.    
A percentage of the population, quite a high percentage, cannot break the chain of high carb bingeing.  The Atkins diet breaks this chain permanently.  It is a question of balancing the good with the bad.     What is better, to be super-fat all your life, with one diet after another, or eat high-proteins and low carbs and stay slim (I refer here to people who have a serious weight problem, persistent weight problem).    
It is also possible to be on a high-protein, low-carb diet and not eat loads of meat.  The important thing to remember is that protein can be obtained from many sources.  Soy products abound in many shops.  Try to eat good quality fats, such as olive oil, almonds ? mono-unsaturated fats.  Try not to eat saturated fats which come from animals and egg yolk.  If you eat meat, have it very lean and add some more olive oil to your salads or grab a handful of almonds.    
There are fast carbs and slow carbs.  Go for the slow ones.  Slow carbs release the carbohydrates slowly into your system, this is better for regulating your insulin levels, and hence controlling your hunger.  If you want to really get into it, get a book which lists the GI of each good.  GI stands for Glycemic Index.  The higher the number, the faster the carb.    
With very obese people keeping to very low GI foods helps a lot.  For people who are interested in their general health, keeping and eye on the amount of high GI foods helps you stay trim. ",6
6,7273,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/11534.php,Mothers turn fearless when peptide level drops,Depression,Depression,,,,5,5,3,4,4,4,1,2,3,,,,,,,,,,"




Everyone knows not to get between a mother and her offspring. What makes these females unafraid when it comes to protecting their young may be low levels of a peptide, or small piece of protein, released in the brain that normally activates fear and  anxiety , according to new research published in the August issue of Behavioral Neuroscience.    

\""We see this fierce protection of offspring is so many animals,\"" says Stephen Gammie, a University of Wisconsin-Madison assistant professor of zoology and lead author of the recent paper. \""There are stories of cats rescuing their kittens from burning buildings and birds swooping down at people when their chicks are on the ground.\""    

In terms of biology, it makes sense that mothers would lay down their own lives to protect their offspring, especially if it means the parents\' genes will be passed down to the next generation, says Gammie. But he adds that despite all the observations and the theories explaining why mothers display this behavior - commonly known as maternal aggression - very little research has investigated the biological mechanisms that turn on this trait in new mothers.    

\""We\'ve known for a long time that fear and anxiety decrease with lactation,\"" explains Gammie. \""Maybe it\'s this decrease that allows mothers to attack during a situation that normally would evoke a fear response.\""    

Testing this hypothesis, the Wisconsin professor and his colleagues studied the link between maternal aggression in mice and levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a peptide that acts on the brain to control behavior.    

About six days after a group of mice gave birth, the new mothers received injections containing either one of three doses of CRH or a saline solution with no amount of the peptide. Following each injection, which was given once a day for four consecutive days, the researchers returned the mother mice to their pups. Twenty-eight minutes later, the researchers removed the pups and introduced a male intruder.    

Under normal conditions, female rodents will fiercely attack the males, says Gammie, noting that the males sometimes eat pups and that \""the best defense for the mom is the offense.\""    

For the study, only the mice that received either no dose or a low dose of the peptide displayed the expected behavior. As the levels of CRH increased, the number of attacks and the duration of them dramatically decreased.    

The results show, for example, that while the mice with the lowest levels of CRH attacked more than 20 times for the duration of about 45 seconds, the mice with moderate levels of the peptide attacked about six times over about eight seconds. Mice with the highest levels of CRH didn\'t attack at all.    

\""When we put the male in the cage, some moms would just sit there. They weren\'t protective at all. If anything they were skittish. They showed a fear response,\"" says Gammie.    

The researchers note that altering the levels of the peptide appeared to affect only maternal aggression; normal maternal behaviors, such as nursing, were observed in all mothers both before and after the encounters with male mice.    

Based on the results, Gammie says, \""Low CRH levels appear to be a necessary part of maternal aggression. If you don\'t keep them low, you won\'t see this fiercely protective behavior.\"" 
   
He adds that this finding - some of the first evidence suggesting a biological mechanism that enables parents, regardless of the potential danger, to defend their offspring - may also begin to explain why mothers occasionally neglect or harm their offspring. 
   
\""Postpartum depression in some individuals has been linked to higher levels of CRH release and an overly active  stress  response,\"" explains Gammie. \""If CRH needs to be low to see maternal protection of offspring, as our work suggests, then it explains why moms with high  postpartum depression  and high CRH not only may neglect, but also may abuse, their children.\""

They're more likely to exhibit  depression  and to be antisocial 
   
Young students plagued by bullying may be at greater risk for developing depression and antisocial behavior, says a study in the current issue of Child Development.
   
Researchers observed the playground interaction of 266 elementary school students from the start of kindergarten to the end of the first grade. The researchers counted all instances of aggression and victimization.
   
'Substantial rates of victimization were observed. On average, children were targets of peer physical or verbal harassment about once every three to six minutes,' lead researcher James Snyder, of Wichita State University, says in a prepared statement.
   
He notes many kindergarten students are verbally and physically abused by their peers. But by the time students reach first grade, an increasing amount of that verbal and physical bullying is focused on a smaller group of perpetual victims.
   
'Some children experienced harassment with great regularity. Other children appeared to respond effectively to aggression by peers such that harassment experiences became increasingly intermittent,' Snyder says.
   
He says more research needs to be done to better understand how some children learn to effectively deal with or avoid repeated bullying while others can't do that.
   
The study found boys who suffered increasing harassment were more likely to demonstrate antisocial and depressive behaviors. In turn, boys who were antisocial or depressed seemed to attract more bullying.
   
Girls who were bullied in kindergarten were more likely to engage in antisocial behavior at home as they grew older and to act increasingly depressed at school if the bullying continued.
   
Antisocial behavior by the boys seemed to offer them some short-term relief from bullying but increased the likelihood of bullying over the long term. On the other hand, antisocial behavior by girls made them more likely to be bullied over short-term and long-term.
   
Information about students' antisocial behaviors -- arguing, bullying and tantrams -- and how often the students seemed sad, lonely or withdrawn was provided by teachers and parents. ",0

CHICAGO (USA) - More than one million Americans will be diagnosed with  cancer  each year, and about 40 percent will develop serious mouth problems as the result of head and neck  radiation therapy  and  chemotherapy .    Severe oral complications, such as the patient's inability to eat and drink, often force doctors to delay or stop the radiation treatment. 
   
To give patients their best chance to fight cancer, the dentist must be added to the cancer treatment team and the patient must visit the dentist before beginning radiation therapy, according to a new report in the November/December 2003 issue of General Dentistry , the Academy of General Dentistry's (AGD) clinical, peer-reviewed journal. 
   
The goal of head and neck radiation is to kill cancer cells while limiting damage to adjacent healthy tissue and structures like salivary glands, jawbones and tissues lining the mouth. However, damage to healthy tissue is unavoidable. 
   
During treatment, the dentist can work with the patient to monitor any changes in their mouth that may occur, such as  dry mouth , increased cavities and painful mouth sores. 
   
?The less oral problems a patient experiences, the more likely the patient will stay on the treatment program,? says Bruce Burton, DMD, MAGD, ABGD, AGD spokesperson. 
   
?Schedule a visit with the dentist one month before starting radiation,? advises Jody S. Harrison, DDS, lead report author. ?Doing so may help prevent serious complications.? 

   Oral complications from neck and head radiation    

- Dry mouth    
- Cavities    
- Oral yeast infections    
- Taste loss    
-  Inflammation  and ulceration of mouth lining    
- Non-healing wounds    
- Limited mouth opening    
- Nutritional deficiencies   
- Pretreatment strategies for cancer patients    

Contact a general dentist for examination before therapy begins    
Have oral diseases treated early    
Extraction of hopeless and questionable teeth should be accomplished three weeks prior to treatment

Twenty-five percent of adolescents and young adults will experience a depressive episode by age 24, yet fewer than 20 

percent receive high-quality care. In a cross-sectional study of 10,962 young adults aged 16 to 29 years with significant 

depressive symptoms, more than one quarter (26 percent) of the participants said they did not intend to accept their 

physician\'s diagnosis of  depression .    
The authors uncovered a number of reasons why these patients refused the diagnosis of depression. Among the most important 

reasons were the belief that the treatment does not work, concern about the stigma from family and friends, and lack of past 

helpful treatment experiences.    
These findings suggest that negative attitudes and concerns about stigma may be important barriers to youth accepting and 

complying with treatment. The authors assert that improved reimbursement to primary care physicians for visits in which they 

negotiate diagnosis and treatment plans with depressed patients could improve treatment rates.

New findings may pave way for improved pain relief methods   

Although physicians administer  radiation therapy  to relieve  bone cancer  pain in more than 100,000 patients each year in the United States, little is known about why the treatment works.    

Using an experimental radiation model, University of Minnesota Cancer Center researchers and colleagues have determined that radiation treatment may relieve pain by reducing bone  tumor  size and decreasing progression of cancer-induced bone destruction.    The findings appear in February issue of the journal Radiation Research.    

'Perhaps the greatest obstacle to improving pain relief following radiation of bone cancer is our limited knowledge regarding mechanisms responsible for decreasing the pain,' said lead investigator Denis Clohisy, M.D., professor of orthopedic surgery in the Medical School and Cancer Center member.    'Future use of the experimental system described in this research should help accelerate the pace of discovery around these mechanisms and help efforts to reduce the burden of pain suffered by bone cancer patients.' 
   
Researchers in this investigation created an experimental model that limited radiation to the site of  cancer  in mice and then used an established bone pain model, imaging techniques, and histologic evaluations to understand the effects of radiation. 
   
The research demonstrated that a localized, single radiation dose decreased painful behavior and increased limb use, which was associated with a decrease in bone destruction and tumor burden.    

Treated mice demonstrated greater pain relief and had significantly less bone destruction and tumor burden than untreated mice. Recent studies have demonstrated that tumor burden and bone destruction each correlate with behavioral and neurochemical measures of pain.

""Screen and treat"" policies to preventing type 2 diabetes are unlikely to have substantial impact on this growing epidemic, concludes a study published by The BMJ.
 
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is rising globally. In the UK, for example, about 3.2 million people have the condition and by 2025 it is predicted that this will increase to five million, at an estimated cost of £23.7bn ($30.2bn, €28.2bn) to the NHS. 
  
There are two approaches to prevention: screen and treat, in which people are identified as ""high risk"" and offered individual intervention, and a population-wide approach, in which everyone is targeted via public health policies. The UK's National Diabetes Prevention Programme follows Australia and the United States in placing the emphasis on a screen and treat approach.
  
But this approach will be effective only if a test exists that correctly identifies those at high risk (sensitivity) while also excluding those at low risk (specificity); and an intervention exists that is acceptable to patients and clinicians.
  
So a team of researchers, led by Professor Trish Greenhalgh at the University of Oxford, assessed the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for pre-diabetes (high risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future) and effectiveness of interventions in preventing onset of type 2 diabetes in people with pre-diabetes.
  
They analysed the results of 49 studies of screening tests and 50 intervention trials. 
  
Screening tests included fasting plasma glucose (higher than normal blood sugar levels after a period of fasting) and raised glycated haemoglobin or HbA1c (proportion of red blood cells with glucose attached, indicating blood glucose levels over the previous 2-3 months).
  
Interventions were lifestyle change or treatment with metformin (a drug that helps lower blood sugar levels).
  
They found that the diagnostic accuracy of tests used to detect pre-diabetes in screening programmes was low - fasting glucose is specific but not sensitive and HbA1c is neither sensitive nor specific - suggesting that large numbers of people will be unnecessarily treated or falsely reassured depending on the test used.
  
Lifestyle interventions lasting three to six years showed a 37% reduction in relative risk of type 2 diabetes, equating to 151 out of 1000 people developing diabetes compared with 239 of 1000 in the control group. This fell to 20% in follow up studies.
  
Use of metformin showed a relative risk reduction of 26% while participants were taking this drug, translating to 218 out of 1000 developing diabetes while taking metformin compared with 295 of 1000 not receiving it.
  
The authors warn that study quality was often low and results may have been affected by bias (problems in study design that can influence results).
  
They conclude that ""screen and treat"" policies will benefit some but not all people at high risk of developing diabetes, and they should be complemented by population-wide approaches for effective diabetes prevention.
  
In a linked editorial, Professor Norman Waugh from Warwick Medical School says adherence to lifestyle change across whole populations is the key to prevention of type 2 diabetes.
  
He points out that ""pre-diabetes"" is an unsatisfactory term because many people so labelled do not develop diabetes, and believes there is a balance to be struck between the medical model of screening and treating of individuals of individuals, and the public health model of changing behaviour in the whole population at risk.
  
He says public health measures targeted at the whole population at risk could include interventions to help weight control, such as changes to taxation of foodstuffs and interventions to make physical activity easier or safer.
  
However, he acknowledges that adherence to lifestyle advice remains poor, and concludes that preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes ""requires effective measures to motivate the general population to protect their own health.""

Low-income people with  depression  are less likely to respond to treatment and more likely to be suicidal than those who have higher incomes, according to a study in the January issue of Archives of General Psychiatry, one of the JAMA/Archives journals.    

Socioeconomic factors, including income, education and occupation, have long been linked to health status, illness and death. Research has shown that people with lower socioeconomic status (SES) are more likely to develop a depressive illness and that their depression is more severe than that of people higher on the SES scale. Several studies have hypothesized that socioeconomic factors, including income and education, would also affect how people respond to medications and other therapies for depression, but have ultimately proved inconclusive, according to background information in the article.    

Alex Cohen, Ph.D., of Harvard Medical School, Boston, and colleagues reanalyzed two previous clinical trials funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and conducted at the University of Pittsburgh. The 248 participants were all 59 years or older and receiving  antidepressant  medications combined with psychotherapy. Their education levels were assessed at the beginning of the original studies. Median annual household income for their areas was obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau. Low-income was defined as less than $25,000, middle-income between $25,000 and $50,000 and high-income more than $50,000. The subjects' depressive symptoms and response to treatment were measured weekly.    

When the authors controlled for demographic factors, such as age and gender, and baseline clinical characteristics, including recurrence of depression and age at onset, they found that people in areas defined as middle-income were significantly more likely to respond to treatment than those in the low-income group. High-income people were only marginally more likely to respond to treatment than middle-income residents, but as a group, high- and middle-income study participants were significantly more likely to respond than those in low-income areas.    

In addition, people in low-income areas were about twice as likely as those in middle-income areas and two and a half times as likely as those in high-income tracts to be suicidal, ""suggesting an inverse relationship between the median household income of the neighborhoods in which subjects resided and suicidality,"" the authors write.    

The authors found that years of education did not affect treatment response or suicidality in this particular study group. ""When the older subjects in our study came of age, economic and social success in the industrial economy was not so dependent on education,"" they write. ""Thus, we speculate that years of education is a less accurate measure of SES in this sample.""    

Based on their findings, the authors ""suggest that future clinical trials routinely gather data on individual income, educational degrees earned, occupation and aspects of the broader social environment such as social capital. However, to transform evidence into knowledge that will inform the treatment of depression, it is essential that future research examines all of the factors (for example, neighborhoods,  stress , social support, race/ethnicity or income inequalities) that may mediate the association between SES and clinical outcomes.""

A newly published study by a University of Wisconsin research team points the way to solving two of life's seemingly eternal but unrelated mysteries: how birds that migrate thousands of miles every year accomplish the feat on very little sleep and what that ability means for humans who are seriously sleep-deprived or face significant sleep problems.    
The study, published online in the July 13 issue of PloS (Public Library of Science) Biology, found that a group of sparrows studied in the laboratory dramatically reduced how long they slept during the time they would ordinarily be migrating. But they were nonetheless able to function and perform normally despite their  sleep deprivation . During times when the birds were not migrating, however, sleep deprivation appeared to impair their performance - similar to what happens to sleep-deprived humans.    

If researchers ascertain how the birds do so well on so little sleep during migration, the finding could benefit people who need to stay awake and function at a high level for long periods of time, as well as those who suffer from sleep disorders of various kinds. In addition, sleep in the migrating birds was similar to sleep changes that typically occur in humans with  depression  or  bipolar disorder .    

""We already know from human studies that people with severe depression and mania show characteristic changes in their sleep patterns, such as having  insomnia  and entering  REM  sleep (the dream stage) too quickly after falling asleep,"" says Ruth Benca, professor of psychiatry at UW Medical School and principal investigator of the study. ""Finding this same pattern in the birds offers us an intriguing model for studying mechanisms for seasonal mood disorders, such as bipolar illness."" 
   
Benca and her colleagues studied captive white-crowned sparrows, songbirds that normally migrate at night between Alaska and Southern California twice a year. When in captivity in laboratory cages during periods when they would normally be migrating, the birds become active and restless at night, moving around and flapping their wings. 
   
Brain sensors measure their sleep patterns continuously during migratory and non-migratory periods. During ""migrating"" times, they slept about one-third as much as usual and moved more quickly into REM sleep, marked by rapid eye movements. At night, when the birds were active, the brain recordings showed they were fully awake, and they did not appear to make up their lost nocturnal sleep with increased napping during the day. 
   
Cognitive tests showed that, during the migration periods, the birds performed normally -- or even improved their ability to learn -- on little sleep; but during other times, sleep deprivation hurt their performance. The researchers theorize that migrating songbirds have developed the ability to apparently reduce their need for sleep temporarily, without suffering the consequences of sleep deprivation. While the researchers do not know how the birds do what they do, they are convinced that the birds' behavior sheds light on sleep processes in general and on some human disorders as well. 
   
The Wisconsin researchers are also affiliated with the UW HealthEmotions Research Institute, created to study the scientific basis of emotion and health.

Enhancing the resources available to low-income, urban African American women to make their neighborhoods safer could 

protect them against poor health and symptoms of  depression , says Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical 

Medicine community health researcher Adam Becker. The study appeared in a recent issue of the Journal of Urban Health. 

   
?Low income urban communities that are racially segregated and have high concentrations of poverty have abundant conditions 

that create  stress  for residents,? says Becker. ?Those stressors contribute to poorer health outcomes. Our research shows the 

value of supporting women\'s efforts to improve their neighborhoods.?    
Becker explains that previous research has suggested a feeling of control over one\'s own life and one\'s choices can protect 

against depression and poor health. This may be true but Becker cautions that feeling responsible for their communities while 

seeing little evidence of change in specific priority issues such as crime and safety may contribute to symptoms of 

depression and erosion of health. 
   
?We found that women who feel powerful in their organizations and in their neighborhoods in general but still feel unsafe in 

their community experience additional frustration,? Becker says. ?Worries about personal and neighborhood safety were 

consistently linked to poor health and more frequent depressive symptoms.?    
Becker recommends that organizations collaborating with people in poor urban environments need to work with them to enhance 

political influence and the responsiveness of policymakers to contribute to community change.    
Becker, his co-authors at the University of Michigan, and their colleagues in the East Side Village Health Worker Partnership 

interviewed 679 African American women living in the east side of Detroit, Mich. The Partnership involves representatives 

from academic institutions, health agencies, and community-based organizations. They collected data about personal health, 

symptoms of depression, household income, worries about safety in the neighborhood, women\'s perceptions of control over their 

lives, the organizations to which they belong, and their neighborhoods. The Partnership worked together with women residents 

of the east side to discuss the results from the survey, and to use those results to plan and implement local interventions 

designed to improve women\'s health through improved neighborhood conditions.

Downward mobility hits men far harder than women, quadrupling their risk of  depression , finds research in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.    

The findings are based on survey responses from 503 men and women taking part in the Newcastle Thousand Families Study, all of whom were born in May and June 1947 to mothers living in Newcastle upon Tyne, north east England.    

Information on their family\'s social class was gathered at their birth. And at the age of 50 participants were asked to describe their own social class at the time and when they were 25, in a bid to track social mobility over the life course.    

They also completed a general health questionnaire, which included questions about their  mental health .    

Living standards have generally improved in Britain since 1947, boosting average life expectancy at birth by 8.5 years in both men and women between 1950 and 1998, say the authors.    

More women than men were clinically depressed at the age of 50, according to the health questionnaire. And around twice as many women as men reported downward mobility between birth and 50 years of age.    

But while a woman\'s risk of depression in mid life was strongly linked to social class at birth, this was not the case for men.    

By the age of 50, downwardly mobile men were over three and a half times as likely to be depressed as their downwardly mobile female peers. And they were around four times as likely to be depressed as men whose social class remained the same.    

The results suggest that women may be more sensitive to the impact of poor socioeconomic status in very early childhood, say the authors.    

And they point out that since the late 1970s, Britain\'s manufacturing base has gradually given way to service industries, which tend to employ more women than men. This may have taken a toll on men\'s role identity and self esteem, which could explain the findings, they say.

A group of Danish investigators, headed by Per Bech (Hillerod) surveyed the literature on  depression  in patients with 

myocardial infarction to assess the methodological quality and to test whether depression leads to an increased 

postmyocardial infarction mortality.    

Medline, Psycinfo, and www.UMI.com were searched, and researchers were contacted in the autumn of 2003. Thirty-one articles 

were reviewed. Only seven articles scored above a predefined level of 75% for acceptable quality. The articles lack 

description of non-responders, recall period for depressive symptoms, validation of applied instrument on target population, 

and sample size large enough to show differences between groups.    

The prevalence rates of depression ranged from 1.6 to 50%. In eight articles, a diagnostic test was applied, in the rest of 

the studies, questionnaires were used. The prevalence of depression was highest in those using patient-completed 

questionnaires. A significant positive association was shown between depression and postmyocardial infarction mortality in 15 

studies, a non-significant association in 14, and in two articles, this was not reported. In articles with data collection 

starting after 1994, a non-significant relation tended to be reported. The studies were generally not of acceptable quality. 

   

They lacked sufficient power to show differences in stated end points between groups. Application of non-validated 

instruments caused large differences in prevalence rates of depression. Future studies should include a minimum of 1,000 

patients, use a validated instrument, re-examine the patients, and describe participants and non-participants in detail. 

   

The conclusion of their analysis is that the data are not conclusive and it is premature o suggest a massive use of 

 antidepressant  drugs with hear attacks.

A chemical found in our breath could provide a flag to warn of dangerously-low blood sugar levels in patients with type 1 diabetes, according to new research the University of Cambridge. The finding, published in the journal Diabetes Care, could explain why some dogs can be trained to spot the warning signs in patients.

Claire Pesterfield, a paediatric diabetes specialist nurse at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has type 1 diabetes, which requires insulin injections to manage blood sugar levels. She also has a golden Labrador dog that has been trained by the charity Medical Detection Dogs to detect when her blood sugar levels are falling to potentially dangerous levels.
 
""Low blood sugar is an everyday threat to me and if it falls too low - which it can do quickly - it can be very dangerous,"" says Claire. ""Magic is incredible - he's not just a wonderful companion, but he's my 'nose' to warn me if I'm at risk of a hypo. If he smells a hypo coming, he'll jump up and put his paws on my shoulders to let me know.""
 
Hypoglycaemia - low blood sugar - can cause problems such as shakiness, disorientation and fatigue; if the patient does not receive a sugar boost in time, it can cause seizures and lead to unconsciousness. In some people with diabetes, these episodes can occur suddenly with little warning.
 
Given the reports of dogs alerting owners to blood glucose changes, researchers at the Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, believed that certain naturally-occurring chemicals in exhaled breath might change when glucose levels were low. In a preliminary study to test this hypothesis, the scientists gradually lowered blood sugar levels under controlled conditions in 8 women, all around their forties, and all with type 1 diabetes. They then used mass spectrometry - which look for chemical signatures - to detect the presence of these chemicals.
 
The researchers found that levels of the chemical isoprene rose significantly at hypoglycaemia - in some cases almost doubling. They believe that dogs may be sensitive to the presence of isoprene, and suggest that it may be possible to develop new detectors that can identify elevated levels of isoprene in patients at risk.
 
""Isoprene is one of the commonest natural chemicals that we find in human breath, but we know surprisingly little about where it comes from,"" says Dr Mark Evans, Honorary Consultant Physician at Addenbrooke's Hospital, University of Cambridge. ""We suspect it's a by-product of the production of cholesterol, but it isn't clear why levels of the chemical rise when patients get very low blood sugar.
 
""Humans aren't sensitive to the presence of isoprene, but dogs with their incredible sense of smell, find it easy to identify and can be trained to alert their owners about dangerously low blood sugar levels. It provides a 'scent' that could help us develop new tests for detecting hypoglycaemia and reducing the risk of potentially life-threatening complications for patients living with diabetes.""
 
The research was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre with support from the Cambridge NIHR Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility.

Progress shown in death rates from four leading  cancers  decline in overall mortality has slowed   

Death rates from the four most common cancers ? lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal ? continued to decline in the late 1990s according to new data from the 'Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1975-2000.'    For all cancers combined, the death rate began to stabilize in the late 1990s, showing neither an increase nor a decrease, while the incidence rate (newly diagnosed cases) began to stabilize in the middle of the decade.   

The report concludes that further reductions in cancer can be achieved but will require strong federal, state, local, and private partnerships to apply evidence-based cancer control measures ? such as screening for  colorectal cancer  ? that reach all segments of the population.    

Analyses of the findings, including new data from the states, also highlight the need for improved delivery of quality cancer care, as well as the development of more effective treatment and screening strategies. 
   
Cancer incidence rates for all types of cancers combined increased from the mid-1970s through 1992, declined from 1992 to 1995, and then stabilized from 1995 to 2000 (there was a slight increase from 1995 to 2000, but it was not statistically significant*).    In this most recent time period, an increase in  breast cancer  in women and  prostate cancer  in men was offset by a long-term decrease in  lung cancer  in men. 
   
Overall death rates increased through 1990, stabilized through 1994, and declined from 1994 through 1998 before becoming stable from 1998 through 2000. There were continuing small declines in death rates for men, but death rates for women have been stable through the late 1990s. 
   
'This report shows that we have made some progress in reducing the burden of cancer in the United States, but much still needs to be done to reach the Healthy People 2010 goals -- including wider application of what science has shown to be effective in preventing, screening, and treating cancer,' said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Julie L.

'The state-specific information featured in this year's report will help states understand and address the cancer burden in their communities.' 
   
The death rate from lung cancer, the leading cancer killer, continues to decrease among white and black men, while the rate of increase has slowed among women, reflecting reductions in tobacco smoking. 
  
'The steep decline in lung cancer rates in men and the recent slowing of an increase in rates in women demonstrate that we can move the trend in the number one cancer killer in the right direction,' said John R. Seffrin, Ph.D., chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society (ACS).    'Further progress will require rigorous application of strategies that we know are effective in reducing tobacco use.' 
   
Death rates from breast cancer continue to fall despite a gradual, long-term increase in the rate of new diagnoses. Declining breast cancer death rates and rising breast cancer incidence rates during the 1990s have been attributed, in part, to increased use of mammography screening.    This report notes that higher rates of late-stage disease in some population groups and geographic areas may reflect delayed access to care, often among women who lacked  health insurance  and among recent immigrants. 
   
Prostate cancer death rates have been declining since 1994, while incidence rates have been rising since 1995, with a 3.0 percent per year increase in white men and a 2.3 percent per year increase in black men.    Clarification of the risks and benefits of prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening, including potential impact on mortality, awaits the conclusion of two randomized clinical trials now in progress. 
   
Colorectal cancer death rates have also been declining for both whites and blacks. Rates began declining in the 1970s, with steeper declines beginning in the mid-1980s. Meanwhile, colorectal cancer incidence rates stabilized beginning in 1996 for all men and women. 
   
The authors of the report are encouraged by the recent continuing declines in death rates from the four leading cancers ? lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal ? declines that were observed nationally and in most states.    

'Biomedical research has dramatically enhanced our understanding of cancer and given us more effective strategies for cancer control,' said Andrew C. von Eschenbach, M.D, Director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which is part of the National Institutes of Health. 'These declines in death rates from four leading cancers are the dividends of those advances.    

During this period of unprecedented growth in cancer knowledge, technology, and resources, the NCI is committed to accelerating these trends, and extending them to other cancers, through the discovery, development and delivery of effective interventions.' 
    
The report examined recent patterns of cancer among whites, African Americans, Asian and Pacific Islanders, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and Hispanics.    From 1992 through 2000, the most recent time period for which data are available, cancer rates among each of these groups differed considerably, but showed encouraging declines in some of the most prevalent cancers. 
   
This year's report includes incidence data from 34 statewide cancer registries that cover 68 percent of the U.S. population. This marks an increase from previous years when data covered only 55 percent of the U.S. population.    

Holly L. Howe, Ph.D., executive director of National American Association of Central Cancer (NAACCR), noted, 'The larger number of states in this year's report, with registries that are providing high quality data to produce meaningful incidence rates, is very encouraging. High quality at the state level is crucial because cancer control planning takes place first and foremost at the local and state levels.'

The underlying  depression , rather than the effects of the drugs themselves,
may explain the increased risk of  heart attack  associated with taking
 antidepressants , suggests research in Heart. More than one in 10 older
people are prescribed antidepressants.    

The findings are based on anonymous prescribing supplied from 644 general
practices across the UK, on 60,000 patients who had had their first heart
attack between 1998 and 2001 and 360,000 randomly selected others, matched
for age and sex.    

Analysis indicated an increased risk of a first heart attack with either
the newer or older class of antidepressants within the first month of
prescription.    

Patients who had been prescribed the older class of tricyclic
antidepressants (TCAs) for the first time were twice as likely to have a
heart attack within the next seven days as patients who had not been
prescribed these drugs.    

And patients prescribed the newer class of selective  serotonin  reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs) were over twice as likely to have a heart attack within
the next seven days.    

But the increased risks of a heart attack were much lower among patients
who took antidepressants for longer than a month. These risks disappeared
after taking account of the extent of existing cardiovascular disease and
depression, which was gleaned from looking at the prescription data before
and after the heart attack (known as self controlled analysis).    

The authors also failed to find any link with specific antidepressants or
with the class of drug, leading them to conclude that any increase in heart
attack risk is more likely to be linked to the underlying depression rather
than the drugs themselves.

Can you distinguish behavior
that suggests a girl is in trouble from typical teen angst or attitude? Is
your teenage daughter at risk for  depression ? One in four are, and you might
not know it.    
    There are wide ranging issues parents must face that include: sexual
escapades (such as friends with benefits), low self-esteem, bullying, drugs,
break-ups, eating disorders and depression.    
    Harvard researcher and adolescent psychotherapist, Dr. Lisa Machoian,
knows what girls are dealing with and the cultural influences that transform
them.    
    In her new book, The Disappearing Girl: Learning the Language of Teenage
Depression (Dutton Books/$24.95.), the first book on the subject, Machoian
presents personal stories from dozens of girls who are living these challenges
daily. She maps out a plan for parents that will assist them in learning how
to prevent, identify, and, most importantly, help girls with these issues.    
    Girls\' depression is not just moods but also about thinking. \""Beyond
learning the risks, signals and symptoms of depression and addressing them
head-on, parents must also learn how to help their daughters navigate and
think critically about the images, the messages, and the unspoken rules of
today\'s adolescence.\""    
    A prominent finding in her research is the fact that, even in the midst of
depression, adolescents have hope inside them-hope of getting help and being
their real self. \""Because hope is still alive, this age is a prime time for
intervention,\"" says Machoian.    
    The book provides parents, teachers, and girls with ways to build healthy
self-esteem, start meaningful conversations and to de-stress.
    According to Machoian, by talking about what girls will encounter in the
world and the meaning it has to them, by raising their awareness of gender
roles, parents can help girls survive their preadolescent and teenage years.
The book includes the Emotional First Aid Kit-strategies for self-expression
and coping.

Parents of very premature babies are more worried about their grown up children's lives than mothers and fathers whose babies were born full term.

And the same new study indicates that those born very premature agree with their parents.

The analysis of their health-related quality of life was conducted by academics at the University of Warwick and University Hospital Bonn. They compared the perception of parents whose children were born very preterm with a control group born at term. They also analysed the opinions of their children. Their paper Health-Related Quality of Life Into Adulthood After Very Preterm Birth has been published in the eminent American journal Pediatrics.

The participants and their parents were asked when they were 13 and then as adults at age 26. The data were collected as part of the prospective Bavarian Longitudinal Study which began in Germany in 1985. In the study 260 individuals born very preterm (at 31 weeks or less) or with very low birth weight (less than 1500g) were compared to 229 who were born full term.

Nicole Baumann is the first author of the research and works with Professor Dieter Wolke at the University of Warwick's department of psychology. Ms Baumann said: ""Previous work from Canada had suggested that the health-related quality of life of preterm born individuals may decrease as they reach adulthood. However, this study found while quality of life improves for term born adults it remains lower for preterm born participants.""

Professor Peter Bartmann, researcher in the department of neonatology at the University Hospital Bonn, and co- author said: ""Very preterm individuals are at risk for health problems and lower health-related quality of life in childhood.""

The academics looked at health-related issues such as vision, hearing, speech, emotion, dexterity and pain. They asked questions relating to these such as 'are you able to recognise a friend on the other side of the street?' and 'are you happy and interested in life?' The researchers also found that participants with lower and parent-perceived health-related quality of life had more often periods of unemployment, more often received social benefits, had fewer friends and were less likely with a partner.

There is a positive element to the study; it indicates that preterm participants don't believe that their health-related quality of life gets worse between age 13 and 26, even though their parents believe the quality does diminish, particularly in pain and emotion.",2
23,6200,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/10342.php,Patients with severe depression improve using guidelines developed by UT Southwestern researchers,Depression,Depression,,,,2,3,4,3,3,4,2,5,4,,,,,,,,,,"




Results from a multiyear study of severely depressed patients treated according to guidelines established by researchers at UT (University of Texas) Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas showed a significant improvement in patients' symptoms and medical outcomes.    

Called the Texas Medication Algorithm Project (TMAP), the guidelines, or algorithms, are a set of comprehensive management tools for doctors treating severely mentally ill patients within Texas' publicly funded  mental health  care system. They are the result of an innovative collaboration between UT Southwestern and the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation (TDMHMR) initiated in fall 1997 to provide more uniform treatment for Texas' mentally ill patients.    

Findings, which showed two to three times greater improvement in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who were treated according to TMAP guidelines, are published today in the Archives of General Psychiatry. MDD is a debilitating illness affecting 7 percent to 12 percent of men and 20 percent to 25 percent of women. It usually recurs, with 10 percent to 30 percent of patients having major depressive episodes that last more than two years. It accounts for up to 60 percent of psychiatric hospitalizations, with 8 percent to 15 percent of those patients committing suicide.    

""TMAP is a disease-management program that includes algorithms and other support systems that help the physician make treatment decisions based on a patient's clinical status, history, symptoms and results up to a specific point,"" said Dr. Madhukar Trivedi, head of the  depression  and  anxiety  disorders program at UT Southwestern, associate professor of psychiatry and the study's lead author. ""This study, which is the first to show the effectiveness of the TMAP project on depression, is quite powerful and compelling.""    

The study compared 547 patients with MDD at 14 clinics. Patients at four clinics received algorithm-based treatment, while others received treatment methods regularly administered by the clinics' doctors.    

""Both groups of patients received treatment from qualified physicians who had access to the same treatments and medications,"" Dr. Trivedi said. ""Therefore all patients improved.    

""But the level of improvement in the disease-management group was twice as much better when measured by a clinician and three times as much better when the patient described his or her own level of improvement. The outcomes for symptomatic improvement, as well as functional improvement, were dramatically better among patients who followed the algorithm-based program. These results should encourage physicians and health-care systems to design management programs based on these easy-to-use algorithms.""    

Patients' outcomes were measured by three standardized tests regularly used to determine levels of depression.    

When TMAP began seven years ago, it was the first program in the nation aimed at establishing and implementing medication guidelines for treating psychiatric illness in the public sector. Besides mapping out algorithms for depression, TMAP also offers parallel guidelines for treating  bipolar disorder  and  schizophrenia . Its organizers hoped the effort could lead to substantial improvements in quality of care and clinical outcomes, along with cost predictability for patients.    

The effort was prompted by research findings pointing to significant variations nationally in medical treatments administered to the mentally ill. When patients moved from clinic to clinic, they often received different treatments.    

Other researchers from UT Southwestern's Department of Psychiatry involved in the study were Drs. John Rush, professor; Michael Kashner, professor; Trisha Suppes, associate professor; assistant professors Thomas Carmody, Melanie Biggs and Kathy Shores-Wilson; and Kenneth Altshuler, clinical professor. Also contributing to the study were researchers from the College of Pharmacy, the University of Texas at Austin; Health Services Research and Development Service Research Career Scientist Program, Department of Veterans Affairs; TDMHMR; and the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.    


The research was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Meadows Foundation, the Lightner-Sams Foundation, the Nanny Hogan Boyd Charitable Trust, TDMHMR, the Center for Mental Health Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Health Services Research and Development Research Career Scientist Award, the United States Pharmacopoeia Convention Inc. and Mental Health Connections.

A new study shows women with  diabetes  have a higher risk of  depression . 
British researchers studied more than 4,200 women between ages 60 and 79. The participants were divided into two groups.    

The first group included women with diabetes, and the second included those without diabetes. Women who did not have diabetes were again divided into four smaller groups, based on their levels of  insulin resistance .
   
Researchers assessed the women?s mental states by evaluating their medications, medical history, and results from a mood questionnaire. Results of the study show women without diabetes, who have increasing levels of insulin resistance, are not likely to be depressed.    

However, the risk of depression increases in women with diabetes. Previous studies have shown individuals who are insulin-resistant may have higher  serotonin  concentrations and may be more prone to depression and even suicide.    

Authors of the study write, ?Insulin resistance is inversely associated with depression. Our results are consistent with a large prospective study in which indicators of  insulin  sensitivity were associated with suicide risk.?    

They say women with diabetes may be more likely to suffer depression because of the clinical diagnosis.
   
Authors of the study conclude, ?If our findings are confirmed, there may be an indication for assessing depressive symptoms among individuals receiving treatments that affect insulin resistance, since depressive symptoms are often disabling and could affect compliance with treatment and quality of life.?

Possible errors in treatment of  depression  -    
A new study documenting the treatment of late-life depression by Canadian health professionals will be presented today at the 

American Psychosomatic Society Annual Meeting in Vancouver, Canada. The study is the first to assess whether people diagnosed 

with late-life depression receive \'guideline concordant pharmacotherapy\'--medication recommended in guidelines issued by the 

Canadian Psychiatric Association.    
The research, conducted by Dr. Maida Sewitch at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) in Montreal and funded by the 

Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), followed the initial medication dispensed to over 5258 Quebec seniors, 

immediately following diagnosis of depression.    
Almost all the seniors studied (84%) were given some form of medication, but incredibly only slightly more than half (55%) 

were given the recommended first-line  antidepressants  according to the Canadian Psychiatric Association. \""The rest (45%) were 

given other drugs, some of which are known to be unhelpful for depression, especially in the elderly,\"" explains Dr. Sewitch. 

   
One medication--a group of psychotropic drugs known as benzodiazepines--was dispensed to nearly 2000 of the study\'s late-life 

depression patients. \""There is evidence to suggest that this group of drugs may worsen depression or result in cognitive 

problems and falls in the elderly,\"" says Dr. Sewitch.    
The study also suggests that men--commonly diagnosed by psychiatrists in hospital settings--are more likely to receive 

guideline concordant medication than women--commonly diagnosed by general practitioners in out-patient settings. \""These 

results highlight possible worrisome errors in the diagnosis and treatment of late-life depression,\"" says Dr. Sewitch. 

\""Further research is required in order to unravel the complexities.\""

A genetic defect may make some men more likely to develop  prostate cancer , research has found.    
A team from Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina examined a gene that controls the body's response to  cancer  triggers. 
   
They found men with the disease were more likely to carry a variant which seems to increase vulnerability to environmental chemicals. 
   
Prostate cancer affects almost 25,000 UK men a year, killing about 13,000. 
   
Although prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, the precise cause of the disease remains is not known. 
   
However, research suggests that a combination of genetic and environmental factors play a role. 
   
High rates of the disease in western countries have been linked to high animal fat diets. Other risk factors include low dietary intake of the mineral  selenium , and exposure to radiation or cadmium. 
   
Researcher Dr Jianfeng Xu said: 'Previous research suggests prostate cancer arises in certain individuals due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. 
   
'Our study suggests that the genetic make-up of some men leaves them more susceptible to potential carcinogens in the environment or hormones in the body that could trigger the disease.' 
   
Dual role 
   
Dr Xu's team studied a gene called CYP1B1, which is thought capable both of causing cancer and preventing it. 
   
The gene helps the body eliminate cancerous environmental chemicals - but can also activate some hormones, turning them into cancer triggers. 
   
This could be particularly important to prostate cancer because its development is strongly dependent on hormones such as  testosterone . 
   
The US scientists found that one particular variant of the gene was found far more frequently in men who had developed prostate cancer than in those who were free from the disease. 
   
Dr Xu said: 'It's an exciting finding because we know the gene interacts with certain cancer-causing chemicals. 
   
'Studying this more closely will bring us closer to finding out what factors in the environment or within the body may trigger the disease.' 
   
Professor Alex Markham, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: 'It's important to find out how genetic and environmental factors combine to cause prostate cancer as, in the future, this will allow us to identify people at high-risk and advise them on ways to prevent the disease.' 
   
The research is published in the British Journal of Cancer. ",0

20-year study at Columbia University Medical Center is first to highlight increased risk of  depression  across three 

generations -    
NEW YORK, NY, January 10, 2005 - Nearly 60 percent of children whose parents and grandparents suffered from depression have a 

psychiatric disorder before they reach their early teens, according to a new study by researchers at Columbia University 

Medical Center (CUMC) and the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI). This is more than double the number of children 

(approx. 28 percent) who develop such disorders with no family history of depression.    
The study, published in the January issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, is the first to follow three generations of 

high-risk families and has taken more than two decades to complete. The CUMC/NYSPI research team began studying 47 first 

generation family members in 1982; then interviewed 86 of their children several times as they grew into adulthood. The team 

has collected data from 161 members of the third generation, whose average age is 12.    
Results found that most of the prepubescent grandchildren with a two-generation history of depression developed  anxiety  

disorders that developed into depression as they aged into adolescence. This trend was also found when the researchers 

previously followed the children's parents through adolescence and adulthood.    
""We have shown that the risk of depression is carried through several generations and that it intensifies as more generations 

are affected,"" said the study's lead author, Myrna Weissman, Ph.D., Professor of psychiatry and epidemiology at Columbia 

University Medical Center and Chief of the Department of Clinical & Genetic Epidemiology at New York State Psychiatric 

Institute. ""Children with a two-generation family history of depression develop anxiety disorders earlier than other children 

and tend to experience more impairment."" Other investigators involved included Priya Wickramaratne, Ph.D. and Virginia 

Warner, MPH.    
Previous studies have shown that the children of a depressed parent are at greater risk of mood and anxiety disorders, but 

the Columbia study is the first to illustrate how the risk intensifies across three generations.    
""Children of parents and grandparents with depression are at extremely high risk for mood and anxiety disorders even when 

they're very young,"" Dr. Weissman says. ""They should be considered for treatment if they develop anxiety disorders, or at 

least monitored very closely.""

Although a recurrence of  breast cancer  is discouraging, it isn't the death sentence it once was, according to researchers from M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston (USA).    They found that with the introduction of new drugs, the survival of women with recurrent breast cancer has improved by about 1% a year since 1974.    
They reported their findings in the journal Cancer (Vol. 100, No. 1: 44-52).    
The researchers reviewed the records of 834 women who had been treated for breast cancer at M. D. Anderson since 1974.    All of the women had received  chemotherapy  after surgery, but had developed a recurrence of their  cancer  despite that treatment. The women were divided into 5 groups according to their recurrence date: 1974-1979, 1980-1984, 1985-1989, 1990-1994 and 1995-2000.    
In each succeeding period, survival improved. In the 1974-79 time period, only 10% of the women lived 5 years. But by the 1995-2000 period, the 5-year survival rate had risen to 44%.    
Although these numbers are encouraging, there were some qualifications attached. Each group differed somewhat in where the first recurrence showed up, and that could affect survival rates.    For example, women whose first recurrence was found in lymph nodes or on the skin had a better outcome than women whose cancer came back in the liver or lung. And, more women in the earlier years had liver and lung recurrences and fewer skin or lymph node recurrences.    
Better Drugs May Make the Difference   
Still, the researchers felt that this difference alone couldn't explain their good results. Instead, they pointed to the explosion in new drugs to treat breast cancer. In the 1970s, only 7 drugs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (news - web sites) to treat breast cancer. In the 1990s this number had risen to 25.    
Examples of newer drugs include the taxanes such as paclitaxel (Taxol) and docetaxel (Taxotere); aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole (Arimidex), letrozole (Femara) and exemestane (Aromasin); and the anti-HER2 protein drug, trastuzumab (Herceptin).    
'Improvement in survival over time would suggest that? new therapies are helping women with recurrent disease live longer,' they wrote.    
The researchers couldn't prove conclusively that the new drugs are the primary reason women with recurrent breast cancer are surviving longer. Better diagnostic tools that allow recurrences to be found earlier may also play a role, for instance.

Physical symptoms (such as  headache ,  back pain , stomach problems, joint or muscle pains, and dizziness) are nearly as common in  depression  as emotional symptoms and are the predominant complaint depressed patients present with in the primary care setting.    
A study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine examined the prevalence, impact on quality of life, and outcome of physical symptoms in depressed patients during nine months of  antidepressant  therapy. While physical symptoms showed, on average, some improvement with antidepressant treatment, the improvement was typically less than for emotional symptoms. The physical symptoms showed the greatest improvement during the initial month of treatment.    

In contrast, depression continued to show gradual improvements over the 9-month period. Unlike depression, however, improvement in physical symptoms typically plateaus with minimal resolution in subsequent months.    

Therefore, it is important to recognize the physical symptoms that commonly co-exist with depression and, if they fail to improve during the first month of treatment, to consider additional therapies. Corresponding author, Dr. Kroenke states, \""It is important to ask patients with depression about physical symptoms at the start of treatment and when assessing improvement ask about physical as well as emotional symptoms.\""

Faslodex provides new hope for women with advanced  breast cancer  whose disease has progressed following prior anti-oestrogen treatment    

European Breast Cancer Congress, Hamburg: AstraZeneca announced today the first European launches of its new breast cancer drug FASLODEXTM (fulvestrant) in Germany and Sweden, with Austria following imminently.    

The novel drug ? an oestrogen receptor antagonist with no agonist effects - is for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose  cancer  has progressed on previous anti-oestrogen treatments such as tamoxifen. Fulvestrant has been launched in the USA since May 2002, and more recently in Brazil in July 2003.   

Fulvestrant was approved for launch in the European Union (EU) on 12 March 2004, making it the first new type of hormonal treatment for oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer to be approved in the EU since 1995. The launch of the drug in Germany, Sweden and Austria therefore provides new hope to the thousands of women suffering from advanced disease in these countries. Further launches throughout Europe are expected during the course of this year. 
   
Commenting on the launch, Professor Kurt Possinger, Head of the Oncology Department at Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany, explains, ?The availability of ?Faslodex? in these countries is very exciting as women who have progressed on prior tamoxifen therapy now have a new additional and effective treatment option which may help extend the window of endocrine therapy and delay the use of cytotoxic chemotherapies with their well-recognised and unwanted side-effects .    

In addition, unlike other endocrine therapies used in postmenopausal women, ?Faslodex? is a once-monthly injection which enables clinicians to have greater contact with their patients to review progress and free women of the worry of remembering to take a daily tablet, allowing them to focus on their life and not their illness.? 

   Breast cancer affects 1 in 9 women at some point in their lives and although many tumours are detected early and treated successfully, a large number of women still go on to be diagnosed with advanced breast cancer.    

The goal of treatment for these women is to achieve an effective disease response and to enable the patient to maintain good quality of life for as long as is feasibly possible. Hormonal agents such as aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen are standard therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, providing an effective and well-tolerated treatment option. However, in time  tumour  cells can grow resistant to treatment with these hormonal therapies and as a result there is a need for new agents to which tumours are not resistant.  

Fulvestrant is an exciting new type of therapy, which brings new choices for women with advanced disease, extending the sequence of ?patient-friendly? hormonal therapies that can be used to control the disease. 
   
Fulvestrant works differently to any other treatment available, although like the other hormonal therapies it interferes with the effect of the hormone ?oestrogen? on tumour growth. Many breast cancers are dependent on the presence of oestrogen to grow.    

Of the current therapies, aromatase inhibitors (e.g. ARIMIDEXTM (anastrozole)) work by reducing the amount of oestrogen in a woman?s body, and tamoxifen (an anti-oestrogen) blocks oestrogen receptors. However, tamoxifen also mimics some of the actions of oestrogen, which can result in unwanted side effects. In contrast, fulvestrant works by blocking and removing the oestrogen receptors in the breast cancer cells and, unlike tamoxifen, does not mimic the actions of oestrogen.
   
Fulvestrant offers durable responses and has tolerability benefits compared with aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen. Fulvestrant is effective following disease progression on prior anti-oestrogen and aromatase inhibitor therapy, in addition both therapies are effective following fulvestrant therapy.    Fulvestrant therefore meets a key unmet need for women with advanced breast cancer, since it can be added in to the sequence of well-tolerated hormonal therapies and may delay the need to resort to cytotoxic chemotherapies with their well-recognised side effects. 
   
The key benefits of fulvestrant are likely to be welcomed by these women and their physicians, since it provides an important new treatment option for patients. These benefits include the following: 
   

Fulvestrant has been shown to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment without any of the side effects commonly associated with cytotoxic  chemotherapy , and to offer some tolerability benefits over the aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen.    

Commonly reported side effects with fulvestrant have included hot flushes, nausea, weakness and  headache . These occurred with similar incidence to anastrozole.    

Fulvestrant was at least as effective as anastrozole in clinical trials to establish its efficacy. 
Unlike many other hormonal therapies, fulvestrant is given once monthly as a slow release formulation administered by an intramuscular injection.    

As such, fulvestrant brings welcome compliance benefits for some women, and for the first time offers a monthly alternative to the once-daily tablet.    

Fulvestrant is approved with the same licence throughout the EU, Norway and Iceland, and will also receive approval in the additional countries added to the EU member states in May 2004.    

The approval of fulvestrant is based on data from two major trials involving over 800 women, which compared the efficacy and tolerability of fulvestrant to that of anastrozole in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease had relapsed on previous hormonal therapies. These trials showed that fulvestrant was at least as effective as anastrozole with respect to efficacy and was also very well tolerated. 1, 2
   


?Faslodex? is a trademark, the property of the AstraZeneca group of companies.
   
AstraZeneca continues its tradition of research excellence and innovation in oncology that led to the development of its current anti-cancer therapies including ?ARIMIDEX? (anastrozole), ?CASODEX? (bicalutamide), ?FASLODEX? (fulvestrant), ?NOLVADEX? (tamoxifen), ?ZOLADEX? (goserelin), ?TOMUDEX? (raltitrexed) and ?IRESSA? (gefitinib) as well as a range of novel targeted products such as anti-proliferatives, anti-angiogenics, vascular targeting and anti-invasive agents.    

AstraZeneca is also harnessing rational drug design technologies to develop new compounds that offer advantages over current cytotoxic and hormonal treatment options. The company has over 20 different anti-cancer projects in research and development.    

Since AstraZeneca released its first anti-cancer drug, ?Nolvadex? (tamoxifen), more than 25 years ago, investment in research has led to the discovery of new anti-cancer agents and other innovative therapeutic strategies which give AstraZeneca an extensive portfolio of developmental agents to complement the established product range.    

AstraZeneca?s product range for breast cancer, include the following: ? 1973: Tamoxifen (NOLVADEXTM): a well-tolerated, oral anti-oestrogen. Now the most widely prescribed agent for the treatment of all stages of breast cancer worldwide. ? 1990: Goserelin (ZOLADEXTM): a well-tolerated and widely-prescribed LHRH analogue, administered by sub-cutaneous injection every 28 days, which reduces sex hormone production.    

Goserelin is now used in the treatment of early and advanced breast cancer in pre-menopausal women with hormone-sensitive disease. ? 1995: Anastrozole (ARIMIDEXTM): the first of a new class of drugs ? selective ?aromatase inhibitors? ? now widely used in the treatment of early and advanced breast cancer in post-menopausal women with hormone sensitive disease. ? 2002: Fulvestrant (FASLODEXTM): a new type of breast cancer therapy (an oestrogen receptor antagonist without known agonist effects). It is now available in the USA and Brazil for the treatment of hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following antioestrogen therapy such as tamoxifen. Approved in Europe in 2004.    

AstraZeneca is a major international healthcare business engaged in the research, development, manufacture and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals and the supply of healthcare services. It is one of the top five pharmaceutical companies in the world with healthcare sales of over $18.8 billion and leading positions in sales of gastrointestinal, oncology, cardiovascular,  neuroscience  and respiratory products. AstraZeneca is listed in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (Global and European) as well as the FTSE4Good Index.      

Fulvestrant, marketed as ?FASLODEX?, is licensed for the treatment of post-menopausal women with oestrogen receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, for disease relapse on or after anti-oestrogen therapy or disease progression on therapy with an anti-oestrogen. Fulvestrant is administered as a once a month intramuscular injection, which may offer compliance benefits and since it is a hormonal treatment, it does not cause the side effects commonly associated with chemotherapy.    Fulvestrant has been available in the USA since May 2002, for the treatment of hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following anti-oestrogen therapy. In that time, fulvestrant has seen rapid uptake in clinical practice beyond expectation and has helped thousands of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.    Fulvestrant works differently to other anti-oestrogen agents for breast cancer, in that it binds to the oestrogen receptor in the breast cancer cell, and this interaction results in loss of the cellular oestrogen receptor (down-regulation). Fulvestrant attacks cancer cells that have grown resistant to current anti-oestrogen treatment options.    

Thousands of women are diagnosed with advanced breast cancer each year ? advanced breast cancer is diagnosed when cancer that is originally confined to the breast is found in other parts of the body. More specifically, a woman is considered to have advanced disease when breast cancer cells also form a tumour in places such as the lungs, liver or bones. In locally advanced disease, the cancer involves spread to the tissues surrounding the breast, such as underlying muscles or skin, but not to distant organs. Extensive lymph node involvement is also counted as locally advanced disease.

A study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine revealed that physicians sometimes misattribute ill-defined physical symptoms to causes other than what may actually be  depression . Patients complaining of physical ailments related to depression may not receive appropriate treatment from their doctors, as compared to patients who present with psychological symptoms. 
   Palpitations, hot flashes, chest pains, or problems with appetite, can be overlooked as signs of depression, according to a study of 200 adults. The study focused on a secondary analysis of patients beginning a new treatment episode for depression, and evaluated the effects of treatment as a result of physical versus psychological symptoms presented.    

\""While we are aware that current depression treatment is most often ineffective,\"" offers author Dr. Robert D. Keeley, \""we attempted to define the patient group that does not receive appropriate treatment, or does not respond to adequate treatment, by returning to the basic medical tenet of listening to the patient.\"" The findings pointed out that physicians sometimes misattribute ill-defined physical symptoms to causes other than depression.    

The most effective treatments, regardless of symptoms, were successful because they matched patient preference. Patients who had physical symptoms of depression were less likely to agree with a medical diagnosis of depression and thus tended to be nonaccepting of  antidepressants , while 72% of patients with psychological symptoms who were presented with antidepressants as a treatment showed improved outcomes.    

The study concludes that physicians need to search for new or modified interventions for depression when treating a patient with physical symptoms to improve the outcome.

The common cold as  cancer  fighter? SLU prof's lifetime work moving into clinical trials   

Saint Louis University researchers receive a patent after decades of research.   

ST. LOUIS (USA) - Can the common cold ever be a good thing? It is if you've figured out a way to genetically engineer the virus so that it fights and kills cancerous cells - while leaving healthy cells intact.   
That's been the work of Dr. William Wold and his colleagues at Saint Louis University School of Medicine for the last 30 years. 
   
'The potential is understandably huge,' said Wold, whose work has just received a U.S. patent after years of study. 
   
Dr. Wold, chair of the department of molecular microbiology and immunology, and his colleagues Karoly Toth, Konstantin Doronin, Ann E. Tollefson, and Mohan Kuppuswamy have found a way to convert the relatively benign 'adenovirus' that causes the common cold into an anti-cancer drug that attacks and destroys cancerous cells. 
   
'Human cancer is currently treated with surgery,  radiation therapy , or  chemotherapy , depending on the cancer type,' Wold said. 'These treatments can be highly successful, but new therapies are required, especially for tumors that have become resistant to chemo- or radiation-therapy.' 
   
Wold's group has developed several new 'adenovirus cancer gene therapy vectors,' changing these genes so the virus will attack cancer cells. 
   
'Some of our vectors are designed to destroy many different types of cancers, others are designed to be specific to colon or  lung cancer . In preclinical testing these vectors were highly effective against cancerous tumors and did not harm normal tissues.' 
   
Wold and his colleagues have done this by modifying one gene so that the virus can grow in cancer cells but NOT normal cells and by boosting the activity of another gene that the virus normally uses to disrupt the cells it has infected.    'When the virus infects cells, it takes the altered genes with it, and those genes attack cancer cells while leaving normal cells intact,' Wold explained. 
   
A U.S. patent (No. 6,627,190) was awarded this fall to Dr. Wold and his team of researchers. Pre-clinical testing is complete and is expected to move soon into clinical trials. 
   
Now this patented technology has been issued and exclusively licensed to a company, Introgen Therapeutics, which made the announcement this morning. Introgen and VirRx, a biotechnology company founded by Wold and with a primary interest in cancer gene therapy, are collaborating on new therapies for cancer and other diseases. 
   
'Our collaboration with Introgen has resulted in the pre-clinical development of an active anti-cancer product that we are eager to introduce into the clinic to further develop the technology,' Wold said. 'This patent demonstrates our innovation and the novelty of our approach. 
   
'There is a long tradition of adenovirus research at Saint Louis University School of Medicine dating back to the 1950s, and it can be argued that SLU is the birthplace of adenovirus molecular virology,' Wold said. 
   
Established in 1836, Saint Louis University School of Medicine has the distinction of awarding the first M.D. degree west of the Mississippi River. Saint Louis University School of Medicine is a pioneer in geriatric medicine, organ transplantation, chronic disease prevention, cardiovascular disease,  neurosciences  and vaccine research, among others.

Significantly decreased blood sugar levels over time - and increased well-being. These are just some of the results of a long-term study at Sahlgrenska Academy of continuous glucose monitoring in persons with type 1 diabetes.

""This is one of few new treatments in recent decades which significantly reduces blood sugar levels for persons with type 1 diabetes, who are dependent on insulin injections,"" notes Marcus Lind, Associate Professor of Diabetology at the department of molecular and clinical medicine, and Chief Physician in Uddevalla.

A total of 161 people took part in the study, from Härnösand in the north to Malmö in the south, each one in need of insulin injections several times per day in order to keep their blood sugar levels in check.

They were randomly selected in different rounds to either use traditional equipment, and prick their finger at least four times per day in order to measure the sugar levels, or use a device which measures the blood sugar continually via a thin filament under the skin on the stomach. A separate unit kept in the pocket would beep or vibrate when the sugar level was to high or too low.

The study lasted 16 months and the patients used each method over a 6-month period, with a four-month ""washout period"" without assisted treatment between each round.

""The principal question was whether there would be a difference in the average blood sugar levels. What we saw was that when patients used this continual blood sugar measurement, they had a lower blood sugar level on average; something which is considered significant in reducing the risk of complications with type 1 diabetes,"" Marcus Lind explains.

The blood sugar value, measured using the marker HbA1c, which gives a mean value over a three-month period, dropped by five millimole per mole; a leap which can be considered justification for giving wider access to the treatment.

""Different interpretations have been made at different hospitals across the country, and the interpretations also vary from one country to the next. A grey zone has been created pending the arrival of this type of long-term study,"" says Marcus Lind.

Previous studies of the technology have been more focused on the verification, over shorter periods, of blood sugar values produced by continual measurement. The fact that the mean sugar levels have been shown to actually decrease is something that can protect the patient group.

""When there are high sugar levels in the cells, various biochemical processes are triggered which increase the risk of damage, primarily to nerves and vessels. If you have high sugar values over long periods, for example, the retinas, kidneys and heart can be affected. The higher the values, the more harmful, which is why this is so important,"" Marcus Lind explains.

The study also shows an increase in treatment satisfaction and well-being. Factors that are important in themselves and which also improve the chances of the treatment working in the long term.

""It's important how the patients experience the treatment in their everyday lives in terms of their willingness to continue; it mustn't get too complicated. Quality of life and well-being are also becoming increasingly emphasised in guidelines for diabetes care,"" says Marcus Lind.

Dartmouth researchers (USA) have developed an algorithm that might someday be used to analyze blood for diagnostic purposes.   

Using data from a mass spectrometer, a device that generates a molecular fingerprint of biological samples, the Dartmouth team's calculations can distinguish healthy blood from diseased blood.   

This study by Ryan Lilien, a Dartmouth M.D./Ph.D. student, Hany Farid, Assistant Professor of Computer Science , and Bruce Donald, the Foley Professor of Computer Science, appeared in the Journal of Computational Biology in December 2003.   

'Our algorithm, named Q5, works on the assumption that the molecular composition of the blood changes between healthy and disease states,' says Donald, the senior researcher on the project.    'The goal of our work is to develop minimally invasive diagnostic methods with high predictive accuracy, and this is a promising first step.'   

Mathematical computations are routinely developed, varied and refined to analyze mass spectrometry data.    

Q5 uses mathematical techniques called Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to differentiate between the mass spectra of healthy and diseased blood samples.    

Q5 learns with each sample it tests, resulting in better accuracy. The algorithm compares the molecular fingerprint of each sample to identify features that differ between the healthy and disease states.
   
'Our algorithm detected  ovarian cancer  with virtually 100% accuracy and  prostate cancer  with approximately 95% accuracy,' explains Lilien, the lead author on the paper.    

'Q5 analyzes the mass spec data and offers control over the threshold between healthy and disease classification. Although we only tested against ovarian and prostate cancer, we think it's possible that Q5 may be used to test for other  cancers  and diseases.'
   
The researchers explain that there is much still to be learned from the different types of information within a sample of blood, and Q5 is one means of extracting new and important data.
   
'Most exciting to us, unlike previous mass spec disease diagnosis methods, Q5 provides clues about the molecular identities of abnormal proteins and peptides, which often cause disease. These altered proteins can serve as biomarkers, helping doctors make diagnosis and also helping researchers design better targeted drugs,' says Donald.

Adolescents with major depressive disorder showed improvement after treatment that combined fluoxetine (an  antidepressant  medication) and  cognitive behavioral therapy  (CBT), according to the results of the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS) published in the August 18 issue of JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association.    
According to background information in the article, major depressive disorder (MDD) is common in adolescence. ""?depression in adolescence is a major risk factor for MDD, suicide, and long-term psycho-social impairment in adulthood. Thus, improvements in the treatment of MDD among adolescents should positively affect public health.""    

John S. March, M.D., M.P.H., from Duke University Medical Center, Durham, N.C., and colleagues from the TADS team, evaluated the effectiveness of four treatments among adolescents with MDD. This study included 439 patients with a primary diagnosis of MDD who ranged in age from 12 to 17 years. They enrolled in the study between spring 2000 and summer 2003 at 13 academic and community clinics across the United States. The participants were randomly assigned to twelve weeks of fluoxetine alone, CBT alone, CBT with fluoxetine, or  placebo  (sugar pill). ""In TADS, CBT is a skills-oriented treatment based on the assumption that  depression  is caused by or maintained by depressive thought patterns and a lack of active, positively reinforcing behavioral patterns; treatment included 15 sessions, which lasted between 50 and 60 minutes, over the first 12 weeks,"" the authors describe. 
   
""Compared with fluoxetine alone and CBT alone, treatment [combining] fluoxetine with CBT was superior,"" the authors report. ""Fluoxetine alone is a superior treatment to CBT alone. Rates of response for fluoxetine with CBT were 71 percent; fluoxetine alone, 60.6 percent; CBT alone, 43.2 percent; and placebo, 34.8 percent. ? Clinically significant suicidal thinking, which was present in 29 percent of the sample at baseline, improved significantly in all 4 treatment groups. Fluoxetine with CBT showed the greatest reduction. Seven (1.6 percent) of 439 patients attempted suicide; there were no completed suicides."" The researchers also found treatment with fluoxetine alone elevated the risk for psychiatric adverse events. ""While fluoxetine did not appear to increase suicidal ideation [thoughts], harm-related adverse events may occur more frequently in fluoxetine-treated patients and CBT may protect against these events,"" the researchers add. 
   
In conclusion the authors write: ""First, given the high prevalence, morbidity, and significant mortality associated with MDD, the identification of depressed adolescents and provision of evidence-based treatment should be mandatory in health care systems. Second, despite calls to restrict access to medications, medical management of MDD with fluoxetine, including careful monitoring for adverse events, should be made widely available, not discouraged. Third, given incremental improvement in outcome when CBT is combined with medication and, as importantly, increased protection from suicidality, CBT also should be readily available as part of comprehensive treatment for depressed adolescents.""

Editorial: Treatment of Adolescents with Major Depression   
In an accompanying editorial, Richard M. Glass, M.D., Deputy Editor, JAMA, and the Department of Psychiatry, University of Chicago, writes, ""the publication of the results of the Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study (TADS) in this issue of JAMA is certainly timely in view of recent and widely publicized controversies regarding treating adolescents with depression. 
   
""?the TADS results raise a mixture of questions and answers regarding the complicated issue of whether antidepressant drug treatment prescribed to treat depression might increase the risk for depression's most dangerous outcome, suicidal behavior. The reduction of suicidal ideation over time is reassuring, but the increased risk for harm-related adverse events observed in the patients receiving fluoxetine suggests that the increase in activation, irritability, or disinhibition sometimes associated with SSRI [selective  serotonin  reuptake inhibitor] treatment warrants careful monitoring in clinical practice. However, the TADS results leave this as a question rather than a firm answer because those specific symptoms were rare among the patients receiving fluoxetine."" 
   
""Probably the most important message from TADS is that carefully assessed, empirically validated treatments are available for adolescents with major depression. A corollary of that message is that depressive illness is a major public health problem with substantial morbidity and mortality for adolescents as well as for adults. The results from this major new trial demonstrate that although treatment of a depressive illness is often successful and gratifying for patients and clinicians, such success typically requires more than a brief visit for prescription of medication. Rather, it requires careful assessment and monitoring in the context of an ongoing patient-physician relationship. Furthermore, the current evidence suggests that the likelihood of a good outcome is enhanced by the combination of appropriate and carefully monitored drug treatment with an empirically validated psychotherapy.""

A few main risk factors account for most stomach and esophagus  cancers  that occur in the general population, new research shows.   
Although numerous reports have identified risk factors for these diseases, 'no study has comprehensively examined their contributions to the cancer burden in the general population,' lead author Dr. Lawrence S. Engel, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and colleagues note.
   
The current study involved 1143 patients with esophagus or  stomach cancer  and 695 healthy people. The patients were diagnosed between 1993 and 1995 in Connecticut, New Jersey, or Washington.
   
The researchers looked at the four main types of cancer that involve the esophagus and stomach: adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, squamous cell cancer of the esophagus, adenocarcinoma of 'cardia' region of the stomach, and adenocarcinoma of other stomach areas.
   
The new findings are reported in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
   
Being overweight accounted for the greatest percentage of esophagus adenocarcinomas--41 percent, the authors state. The next biggest contributor--ever smoking--accounted for 40 percent of cases. Together, being overweight, ever smoking, reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus, and low fruit and vegetable consumption accounted for 79 percent of cases.
   
Alcohol consumption was responsible for the greatest percentage of esophageal squamous cell cancers--72 percent. Nearly 90 percent of cases could be accounted for by alcohol use, a history of ever smoking, and low fruit and vegetable intake.
   
For stomach cardia adenocarcinomas, smoking was the biggest contributor, responsible for 45 percent of cases. A history of ever smoking and being overweight together accounted for 56 percent of cases.
   
For other stomach adenocarcinomas, increased nitrite intake, a compound found in smoked foods, accounted for the greatest percentage of cases--41 percent, the researchers point out.
   
The rapid rise in the rate of new cases of stomach and esophagus cancers that has occurred in Western populations appears to result from increases in the prevalence of several risk factors that people are capable of changing, the authors note.
   
'Efforts to reduce the prevalence of being overweight, having gastroesophageal reflux, and smoking and to improve diet could reverse this troubling cancer trend,' they add.

Cholesterol-lowering medications might reduce women's risk of  breast cancer  as well as  heart disease , a new study suggests.   

The notion that inhibiting  cholesterol  might prevent the development of tumors is a decade old. So far, results of studies of cholesterol-lowering drugs have been inconclusive. Some studies have found no effect on  cancer  risk, some have found a benefit and others have found an increased risk of cancer in certain users of the drugs.
   
The new study is one of the first to look specifically at breast cancer risk. But lead author Jane Cauley says it's too early to add reduced breast cancer risk to the list of cholesterol-lowering medications' benefits.
   
'We just need more information and more confirmatory studies,' says Cauley, an epidemiologist at the University of Pittsburgh.
   
Cauley and her fellow researchers studied 7,528 women 65 and older whose average age was 77. The women were participants in a study of osteoporotic  fractures .
   
At one clinic visit during the study, researchers asked the women whether they took any cholesterol-lowering drugs. To verify the information, the researchers asked the women to bring all of their medications to the clinic.
   
About 8% of the women reported that they were taking a cholesterol-lowering drug ? half statins, half other drugs such as niacin or gemfibrozil. The researchers did not collect information about how long the women had been taking the drugs.   

For the most part, women who took cholesterol-lowering drugs had similar patterns of hormone therapy use as women who didn't. (The government-sponsored Women's Health Initiative found that taking  estrogen  plus progestin raised women's breast cancer risk.)
   
None of the women had breast cancer at the time the researchers collected information about their use of cholesterol-lowering medication. The scientists then followed them, for nearly seven years on average, to see who developed breast cancer.    A total of 244 women were diagnosed with the disease during the follow-up period, the researchers report in the October issue of the Journal of Women's Health.
   
After accounting for age and weight, two factors related to breast cancer risk, the researchers found that statin users were three-fourths less likely to develop breast cancer than women who weren't taking any cholesterol-lowering medication. Users of other cholesterol-lowering drugs were two-thirds less likely to develop the disease. ",1

Successful treatment of  depression  not only improves older adults\' emotional health, but also helps them perform such 

daily activities as remembering to take medications, according to a study published in the March 2005 issue of the Journal of 

the American Geriatrics Society by Indiana University School of Medicine researchers.    
This is the first study to report that successful treatment of depression in older adults also improves their ability to 

perform tasks critical to independent living such as keeping track of medications or managing money. Prior clinical trials of 

successful treatment of depression in this age group reported improvement in emotional functioning, but had not demonstrated 

that improved emotional health also translated into improved physical health. Older adults with depression report persistent 

greater functional impairment than those without depression.    
\""This study is important for two reasons,\"" said Christopher Callahan, M.D., Cornelius W. and Yvonne Pettinga Professor in 

Aging Research at the IU School of Medicine. \""First, it shows that even older adults with failing physical health can be 

successfully treated for depression. Second, it shows that treating the depression also helps slow the physical decline.\"" 

   
Dr. Callahan is director of the Indiana University Center for Aging Research and principal author of the article.    
Study participants were placed randomly into two groups. One group received standard care for depression from their primary 

care physician. A depression clinical specialist (a nurse or psychologist) as well the patient\'s primary care physician 

co-managed depression treatment for those in the second group.    
In both groups, patients whose depression improved were more likely to experience improvement in physical functioning than 

patients whose depression was not successfully treated, the study found.    
Depression was more likely to improve in those who received treatment by collaborative care management than those who had 

usual care. One hallmark of the intervention was the \""stepped care\"" approach or the ability to increase the intensity of the 

treatment over time if patients did not respond to initial treatments.    
This study is part of Project IMPACT, which followed 1,801 patients age 60 and older with major depressive symptoms for 12 

months. Participants in the IMPACT study, the largest clinical trial of late-life depression reported to date, were from 18 

primary care clinics across the United States.    
\""Patients with late-life depression often experience a downward spiral of worsening depression and function,\"" the study 

authors concluded. \""Effective treatment of late-life depression by a collaborative stepped-care program in primary care may 

interrupt this downward spiral.\""    
In an accompanying editorial, Duke University\'s Dan Blazer, M.D., Ph.D., noted the bench-to-bedside practicality of this 

research. \""The findings of the IMPACT study are prime for translation into clinical practice changes that will improve the 

quality of life for many older adults. Primary care practices take note!\""    
The study was supported by grants from the John A. Hartford Foundation, the California Healthcare Foundation, the Hogg 

Foundation and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Led by Professor Craig Currie of the University's School of Medicine, the retrospective research looked at people with type 2 diabetes who were treated with insulin with or without metformin from the year 2000 onwards.

12,020 people were identified from a general practice data source, and the research team tracked them for three and a half years on average, from the time they were first prescribed insulin.

The researchers found than when used in conjunction with insulin, metformin had the potential to reduce mortality and heart attacks. They also found that there was no difference in the risk of cancer between people treated with insulin as a single therapy or in combination with metformin.

Professor Currie said: ""Since 1991, the rate of insulin use in type 2 diabetes increased more than six-fold in the UK. In more recent years, metformin has also been used alongside insulin as a treatment.

""Previously, our work showed that increased insulin dose is linked with mortality, cancer and heart attacks. Existing studies have also shown that metformin can attenuate the risks associated with insulin.

""In this research we examined insulin dose along with the impact of combining insulin with metformin. We found that there was a considerable reduction in deaths and heart problems when this cheap and common drug was used in conjunction with insulin.

Around 3.9m people live with diabetes in the UK, with more than 90% of those affected having type 2 diabetes.

""While this research indicates the potential of using these treatments together, further studies are needed to determine the risks and benefits of insulin in type 2 diabetes and the possible benefits associated with the administration of metformin alongside insulin,"" added Professor Currie.",0

Scientists have found a way to predict which women with  breast cancer  have the most aggressive forms of the disease.   
A test which can be carried out on  tumour  tissue removed from the breast detects a chemical linked to the speed the tumour has been growing. 
   
Researchers from the MRC Cancer Cell Unit at Cambridge University say the technique could help doctors give women the right level of treatment. 
   
Dr Nick Coleman said that the finding was 'good news' for women. 
   
The research, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, focuses on a cell protein called Mcm-2, which can be found in breast tumours. 
   
The first step in breast cancer treatment is to take a tiny tissue sample to diagnose the disease, and this could be tested at the same time for this chemical. 
   
Lower doses
   
Different tumours have different levels of Mcm-2, and scientists worked out that those with certain levels tended to grow more quickly, and require higher doses of  radiotherapy  and  chemotherapy , or a course of treatment that lasts longer. 
   
Conversely, Mcm-2 levels could also be linked to a slow-growing tumour which perhaps might need a shorter course of treatment or a lower dose. 
   
'Great potential'
   
Dr Coleman said: 'An accurate assessment of the outcome following surgery is key to choosing how much further therapy is needed for an individual patient. 
   
'It is important that patients receive neither too little nor too much additional treatment for their tumours. 
   
'The discovery has the potential to make a difference to the lives of thousands of women as breast cancer is the most common type of  cancer  to affect women in the UK.' 
   
Professor Robert Souhami, from Cancer Research UK, one of the research funders, said that the findings would hopefully prove 'helpful' to doctors trying to work out how intensively to treat breast cancer patients. 
   
However, he said that further research was now required to validate the results. ",0

CHICAGO (USA) ? Morning  headaches  affect about one person in 13 in the general population and are associated with  depression  and  anxiety  disorders, according to an article in the January 12 issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine, one of the JAMA/Archives journals.    

According to the article, waking up with a headache is traditionally associated with sleep disorders. Studies have reported a high association between morning headache and  obstructive sleep apnea  syndrome, and snoring.    The prevalence of morning headache in the general population is not known, although according to a Swedish study, 5 percent of the population often experiences morning headache.
   
Maurice M. Ohayon, M.D., D.Sc., Ph.D., of Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, Calif., investigated the prevalence of chronic morning headaches (CMH) in the general population, and their relationship to sociodemographic characteristics, controlled substance use, and clinical, sleep and mental disorders.
   
A telephone questionnaire was used to survey 18,980 people (15 years or older) representative of the populations of the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. The questionnaire included questions about morning headaches, clinical disorders, use of psychoactive substances, and sleep and mental disorders.
   
Overall, the prevalence of CMH was 7.6 percent (n=1,442). CMH were reported to occur 'daily' by 1.3 percent of the individuals surveyed; 'often' by 4.4 percent of the survey sample; and 'sometimes' by 1.9 percent of the sample. Rates were higher in women than in men (8.4 percent vs. 6.7 percent) and in people aged between 45 and 64 years (about 9 percent).    The most significant factors associated with CMH were anxiety and depressive disorders. 
   
Dr. Ohayon also found that CMH was significantly associated with sleep-related breathing disorders,  hypertension , musculoskeletal diseases, use of anxiolytic medication and heavy alcohol consumption. 
   
'Morning headache affects one individual in 13 in the general population,' Dr. Ohayon writes. 'Chronic morning headaches are a good indicator of major depressive disorders and  insomnia  disorders. Contrary to what was previously suggested, however, they are not specific to sleep-related breathing disorder,' concludes Dr. Ohayon.

Sudden unexpected infant death (SUID), which includes sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), is the leading cause of death in infants 1 month to 1 year of age in the United States.  Although the reason is unknown, maternal age less than 20 years is associated with an increased risk of SIDS.  In a new study scheduled for publication in The Journal of Pediatrics, researchers found that although teenage mothers know the recommendations in regards to safe sleeping practices, many deliberately do not follow those recommendations.
 
Dr. Michelle Caraballo and researchers from the University of Colorado and Children's Hospital Colorado recruited 43 teenage mothers from high school daycare centers throughout Colorado to participate in seven focus groups about safe sleep for their infants (2-21 months of age).  According to Dr. Caraballo, ""We sought to understand participants' information sources and factors motivating decision-making about their infants' sleep practices."" 
 
Most of the teenage mothers were familiar with SIDS and the recommendations against co-sleeping and the use of blankets and pillows in the baby's sleeping area.  Despite this, co-sleeping and the use of soft bedding, especially blankets, were extremely common.  The most prevalent reasons given for co-sleeping were the perception that babies seemed to sleep better and were safest in bed with them; many mothers used blankets because they were concerned that babies would be cold and they thought that babies are more comfortable with blankets.  All of the teenage mothers believed that their instincts were more accurate than anyone else's, even when those instincts are in direct contradiction to expert advice and safe sleep recommendations. 
 
Although first time mothers typically feel timid and uncertain, the teenage mothers in the focus groups displayed an almost cavalier confidence in their ability to decide the right thing to do regarding sleep practices.  ""We learned that almost all teenage mothers were already aware of the recommendations,"" notes Dr. Caraballo, ""yet they were making deliberate decisions to practice unsafe behaviors.""  New approaches, including making sure healthcare providers are providing accurate, consistent information and innovative public service announcements targeting teenage mothers, should be considered to improve safe sleep behaviors in this high-risk group.

Surprisingly, people with mild  depression  are actually more tuned into the feelings of others than those who aren't depressed, a team of Queen's psychologists has discovered.    

""This was quite unexpected because we tend to think that the opposite is true,"" says lead researcher Kate Harkness. ""For example, people with depression are more likely to have problems in a number of social areas.""    

The researchers were so taken aback by the findings, they decided to replicate the study with another group of participants. The second study produced the same results: People with mild symptoms of depression pay more attention to details of their social environment than those who are not depressed.    

Their report on what is known as ""mental state decoding"" - or identifying other people's emotional states from social cues such as eye expressions - is published today in the international journal, Cognition and Emotion.    

Also on the research team from the Queen's Psychology Department are Professors Mark Sabbagh and Jill Jacobson, and students Neeta Chowdrey and Tina Chen. Drs. Roumen Milev and Michela David at Providence Continuing Care Centre, Mental Health Services, collaborated on the study as well.    

Previous related research by the Queen's investigators has been conducted on people diagnosed with clinical depression. In this case, the clinically depressed participants performed much worse on tests of mental state decoding than people who weren't depressed.    

To explain the apparent discrepancy between those with mild and clinical depression, the researchers suggest that becoming mildly depressed (dysphoric) can heighten concern about your surroundings. ""People with mild levels of depression may initially experience feelings of helplessness, and a desire to regain control of their social world,"" says Dr. Harkness. ""They might be specially motivated to scan their environment in a very detailed way, to find subtle social cues indicating what others are thinking and feeling.""    

The idea that mild depression differs from clinical depression is a controversial one, the psychologist adds. Although it is often viewed as a continuum, she believes that depression may also contain thresholds such as the one identified in this study. ""Once you pass the threshold, you're into something very different,"" she says.    

Funding for this study comes from a New Opportunities Grant from the Canada Foundation for Innovation.

The butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker may be more famous, but the pharmacist, the engineer, and the doctor may be onto something big.    
The latter group has combined resources and knowledge to create a novel way to deliver a new  lung cancer  treatment. The new system, which uses 'nanoparticle cluster bombs,' has proven effective in treating cancerous lung cells in vitro (in a petri dish), it was reported today in the International Journal of Pharmaceuticals.    
The research team from the University of Alberta will conduct in vivo tests (in live specimens) early this year, with plans for clinical trials to follow.    
'Based on what we've been able to do so far, we have practical hopes that a new lung delivery platform for lung cancer can be established,' said Dr. Raimar Loebenberg, a professor of pharmacy at the U of A.    
The three researchers--Loebenberg; Dr. Warren Finlay, a U of A mechanical engineering professor; and Dr. Wilson Roa, a U of A oncology professor--have applied for a patent on the lung cancer nanoparticle drug delivery system.    
Loebenberg explained that the drug sits in powder form in the inhaler, which is similar to the device that asthmatics use. However, the difference between regular drugs and 'nanoparticle cluster bombs,' Loebenberg said, comes when the powder arrives in the lungs, where it dissolves into nanoparticles upon contact with moisture in the lung--usually mucous.    
Each grain of drug powder contains 'a few thousand nanoparticles,' Finlay explained. 'Once the nanoparticles are active in the lung they have a tremendous advantage over regular drugs, because they are better able to do exactly what we want them to.'    
The idea is that the nanoparticles can be programmed to escape immune system surveillance like a Trojan Horse, and carry designer drugs that target  cancer  cells while leaving healthy cells alone.    
'This drug and this delivery system have a lot of potential--there are a lot of different things we can do as we're able to control where and when the nanoparticles release their payload,' said Finlay, who also has a patent pending on a new inhaler to go with the nanoparticle drug platform.     'This platform system may be just the beginning. We're looking at a lot of cool things we can do down the road.'    
'At this point, we're excited and encouraged about what we've done and what we could do in the future,' Loebenberg said, adding that the progress is due to the interdisciplinary collaboration between experts in three fields.    
'This was not the result of one brain, but three,' he said. 'At first, when we started working together we didn't understand each other very well, but now I think we make a pretty good team, and I think we've created something that has good potential for a solution to lung cancer.'

Treatment for  depression  may be stymied in people with moderate to severe body pain, according to a new study.    

Researchers Matthew J. Bair, M.D., formerly of the Regenstrief Institute, and colleagues uncovered the connection by analyzing the results of a clinical trial of 573 depression patients taking medications like Prozac, Paxil or Zoloft. Their findings are published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine.
   
Although depression improved in most of the patients after three months of drug therapy, 24 percent had persistently high depression scores. The therapy was most likely to fail among those who reported moderate to severe pain at the beginning of their treatment.

   ?In particular, the odds of a poor depression treatment response were twice as high in patients with moderate pain at baseline and three to four times as high in those with severe pain,? Bair says.
   
Factors like pain may help explain why  antidepressants  have a mixed record of success, Bair says. Between 50 and 70 percent of depressed patients find only partial relief with their medications.
   
Researchers have long known that pain and depression often go hand in hand, but there are few studies of how pain might affect depression treatment. In the Bair study, more than two-thirds of the patients reported some degree of pain at the start of their treatment.    Twenty-five percent said their pain was mild, 30 percent had moderate pain and 14 percent said they had severe pain.
   
?We believe a treatment model that incorporates assessment and treatment of both depression and pain is desirable,? Bair says.
   
The study was supported by the Health Resources and Service Administration and Eli Lilly and Co.

Cancer patients with one of the most lethal forms of the disease have had their lives prolonged by a vaccine developed in New York.
   
 Cancer  of the pancreas kills 95 per cent of sufferers within two years. In a preliminary trial patients who received the vaccine survived twice as long on average.
   
Of the 10 patients treated, one was still alive and free of the disease five years on, with two alive and disease-free after two years. Typically, patients survive 14-15 months after surgery for this cancer. The pancreas produces enzymes and  insulin  essential for digestion in the gut.
   
Researchers, who presented the findings to the European Cancer Conference in Copenhagen yesterday, emphasised they could not yet tell if the vaccine would work on all patients.
   
Dr Robert Maki, of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre in New York, said: 'The finding of even a few patients surviving two or more years is promising. However, and this is a big however, we may be biased in who we selected for the study. Perhaps, ... we got a few people who were destined to do well.'
   
Confirmation of the findings would have to await the results from a proper randomised controlled trial, he said.
   
All the study subjects had their cancer removed by surgery. The vaccine, based on a protein, HSPPC-96, was then prepared from the patient's  tumour , and administered within eight weeks of surgery.
   
None had side-effects from the vaccine and none had  chemotherapy  or  radiotherapy . Dr Maki said that a better picture of the vaccine would emerge from the clinical results of a larger study.
   
HSPPC-96 has already been shown to have dramatic effects in some patients with  melanoma , the most serious form of  skin cancer . It is also being tested as a vaccine against  kidney cancer .
   
The conference was told that deaths from  prostate cancer , the commonest cancer in men, are falling in America and Europe due to early detection and treatment. Professor Sir Richard Peto of Oxford University said that new figures showed prostate cancer deaths in men aged 50-74 fell by one third between 1990 and 2000, and by one quarter in men aged 75-84.

Teens who engage in high-risk behaviors involving sex and drugs have significantly higher odds of  depression ,  suicidal thoughts  and suicide attempts than teens who say no to sex and drugs, according to a study.   

?These results suggest that healthcare professionals who identify adolescent patients reporting sexual intercourse or drug use should strongly consider screening for depression and risk of suicide,? says study author Denise D. Hallfors, Ph.D., a Senior Research Scientist at the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.    

Adolescents are no strangers to the phenomena of depression and suicide. Previous research found 28 percent of U.S. high school students experienced severe depression, and the third leading cause of death for 15- to 19-year-olds is suicide. Suicide death rates among 15- to 19-year-olds doubled between 1960 and 2001, according to the study.   

Hallfors and colleagues analyzed various sex and drug behavior patterns via data from a survey of nearly 19,000 teens in grades 7 through 12. The data were gathered in the mid-1990s from 132 U.S. schools as part of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.   

The researchers clustered the teens in 16 groups according to their behaviors. Groups included the abstainers, who eschewed sex and drugs; sex dabblers; alcohol and sex dabblers; teens with multiple sexual partners; and illegal drug users.   

Abstainers had the lowest levels of depression, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts, while teens in groups associated with sex and drugs, and heavy use of illegal drugs such as marijuana had the highest levels. In between were the dabblers in sex, drugs, alcohol and tobacco.    

The results appear in the current issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.   

The researchers found girls less likely than boys to pursue high-risk behaviors, but girls who did were more vulnerable than boys to the constellation of depression, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts.   

Another interesting finding involved the association of socioeconomic status with depression. While higher socioeconomic status reduced the likelihood of depression by about half, it increased the risk of suicidal thoughts. Hallfors and colleagues call for more research to examine this phenomenon.
   
Further research is needed to understand which comes first: sex and drugs or poor  mental health . But until then, Hallfors and colleagues advise healthcare professionals to screen all teens for sexual behaviors and drug use. Those who engage in such behaviors?especially those who do more than dabble in them?should be screened for depression and suicide risk also.
   
?It is particularly important not to miss opportunities to diagnose depression because effective treatments are available, or to overlook suicide risk because suicide can be prevented,? Hallfors says.
   
Funding for the study was from the National Institute of Drug Abuse.

The research team, from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, MA, set out to find if the time children had for their lunch affected the food choices they made and how much they consumed. 

Senior author Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition, says that ""every school day the National School Lunch Program helps to feed over 30 million children in 100,000 schools across the US, yet little research has been done in this field.""

Just over 1,000 students from six elementary and middle schools took part in the study, all of whom had lunch periods ranging from 20-30 minutes. They all came from a low-income urban school district in Massachusetts - an important factor since students from low-income families get nearly half their daily nutritional requirement from their school meals. 

The researchers found that children who had less than 20 minutes to eat their meal in a lunch period not only ate less, but they ate less healthily. 

Rather than finishing part of the meal and leaving the rest, the team found students with less time made a start on their entrée, vegetables and milk - but finished nothing. Children with less time got through 13% less of their entrées, 12% less of their vegetables and 10% less of their milk.

Commenting on their findings, Rimm says:



The research also found that when it came to picking a piece of fruit, the rushed group made a fruit selection 44% of the time compared with those with more time to eat, who made a fruit selection 57% of the time. 

While federal guidelines were recently issued on the nutritional quality of the meals provided, there are currently no standards on the length of the lunch period. 

Making lunch periods longer is not always feasible, so the answer, according to the researchers, is for schools to look at ways to get students to their meal on time and through the lunch lines more quickly; having arrived late or stood in a serving line, some students had only 10 minutes at the table.

""Increasing the number of serving lines, more efficient cashiers, and/or an automated point of sale system can all lead to enhanced efficiency for students going through lunch lines,"" says lead investigator Juliana Cohen, adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition.

Earlier this year, Medical News Today reported on how chefs in school kitchens may encourage healthy eating.

Some individuals with a history of  depression  may sink back into thinking patterns associated with the condition when faced with mild stresses or sadness, increasing their risk for relapse, according to a report in the July issue of Archives of General Psychiatry, one of the JAMA/Archives journals.
   
Many patients who recover from depression eventually relapse, according to background information in the article. Management of depression usually focuses on alleviating symptoms rather than reducing the risk for recurrence or identifying patients who might relapse after successful treatment. Previous studies have found that some patients who have recovered from depression still show cognitive processes--patterns in thinking, learning and memory--commonly associated with the condition, while others in remission do not. Such cognitive processes include certain ways of explaining events or particular assumptions about self-worth.
   
Zindel V. Segal, Ph.D., University of Toronto and Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Ontario, and colleagues randomly assigned 301 patients with major depressive disorder to receive either  antidepressant  medications or  cognitive behavioral therapy  (a kind of psychotherapy designed to modify the cognitive processes that are typically associated with depression). Ninety-nine of those whose depression went into remission participated in a second phase of the trial. These 99 participants rated their current mood on a visual scale from sad to happy and underwent an assessment of their dysfunctional attitudes, signs of the cognitive processes that are associated with depression. The researchers then provoked a sad mood by asking participants to listen to a piece of music and try to recall a time in their lives when they felt sad. After this exercise, the participants rated their mood and underwent the dysfunctional attitude assessment a second time and were observed bimonthly for the next 18 months.
   
Seventy-eight patients completed the full 18 months of follow-up; 47.5 percent of those who had recovered through antidepressant medication use and 39 percent of those who received cognitive behavioral therapy relapsed during that time period. Regardless of the type of treatment, those who had greater cognitive reactivity--that is, they displayed significantly more dysfunctional beliefs after the sad mood provocation than before it--were more likely to relapse during the 18-month follow-up. This association held true even when researchers considered the number of past episodes of depression each patient had experienced, previously the best known way to predict relapse. In addition, those who took antidepressants were more likely to have greater cognitive reactivity than those in the cognitive behavioral therapy group.
   
""Our study indicates that even a mild negative mood, when experienced by someone with a history of depression, can reinstate some of the cognitive features observed in depression itself,"" the authors write. ""The presence of such reactivity in recovered patients signals a residual but heightened risk for episode relapse that has not been fully addressed by treatment.""
   
Future depression management approaches might aim to help prevent relapse by teaching patients to reflect on the factors that influence their thinking, the authors suggest. ""Such treatments may include components that first help patients deliberately monitor and observe their thinking patterns when they feel sad, and then help patients respond to these thoughts and feelings in a way that allows them to inhibit the cognitive elaboration of their content,"" they write.

A brain imaging study by the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has found that an emotion-regulating brain circuit is overactive in people prone to  depression  ? even when they are not depressed. Researchers discovered the abnormality in brains of those whose depressions relapsed when a key brain chemical messenger was experimentally reduced. Even when in remission, most subjects with a history of mood disorder experienced a temporary recurrence of symptoms when their brains were experimentally sapped of tryptophan, the chemical precursor of  serotonin , the neurotransmitter that is boosted by  antidepressants .    

Neither a  placebo  procedure in patients nor tryptophan depletion in healthy volunteers triggered the mood and brain activity changes. Brain scans revealed that a key emotion-processing circuit was overactive only in patients in remission ? whether or not they had re-experienced symptoms ? and not in controls. Since the abnormal activity did not reflect mood state, the finding suggests that tryptophan depletion unmasks an inborn trait associated with depression.   

Alexander Neumeister, M.D., Dennis Charney, M.D., Wayne Drevets, M.D., NIMH Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program, and colleagues, report on their positron emission tomography (PET) scan study in the August 2004 Archives of General Psychiatry.   

The NIMH researchers and others had previously shown that omitting tryptophan from a cocktail of several other essential amino acids washes out the precursor chemical from the blood and brain, depleting serotonin and often triggering symptoms in people with a history of depression ? and even in healthy people from depression-prone families. This added to evidence that a genetic predisposition that renders some people vulnerable to inadequate serotonin activity may be at the root of the mood disorder.    

The researchers scanned subjects after their blood tryptophan levels were reduced by about three-fourths, using a radioactive tracer (a form of glucose, the brain's fuel) which reveals where the brain is active during a particular experimental condition.    

They randomly gave 27 unmedicated depressed patients-in-remission and 19 controls either pills containing seven essential amino acids, such as lysine and valine, or identical-looking placebo pills. Subjects received either the active pills or placebos in repeated trials over several days in a blind, crossover design.   

Sixteen (59 percent) of the patients experienced a transient return of symptoms under tryptophan depletion; their mood lifted to normal by the next day. Compared to controls, the patients showed increased brain activity in a circuit coursing through the front and center of the brain (orbitofrontal cortex, thalamus, anterior cingulate, and ventral striatum) ? areas involved in regulating emotions and motivation that have been implicated in previous studies of depression. Whereas previous studies interpreted the circuit activation as a transient, mood-dependent phenomenon, the new evidence suggests that circuit over-activation is likely an underlying vulnerability trait, say the researchers. 
   
Because of its ability to unmask what appears to be a trait marker for major depressive disorder, the researchers suggest that tryptophan depletion may be a useful tool for studying the genetic basis of depression. 
   
""Since brain function appears to be disregulated even when patients are in remission, they need to continue long-term treatment beyond the symptomatic phase of their illness,"" noted Neumeister, who recently moved to the Yale University psychiatry department.

One in five patients hospitalized for  heart attack  suffers from major  depression , and these patients may be more likely 

than other heart attack patients to need hospital care again within a year for a cardiac problem and three times as likely to 

die from a future attack or other heart problems, according to a new evidence report by HHS' Agency for Healthcare Research 

and Quality.    
The scientific evidence review on which the report is based suggests that 60 percent to 70 percent of individuals who become 

depressed when hospitalized for heart attack continue to suffer from depression for 1 month to 4 months or more after 

discharge. Major depression lasts 2 weeks or longer and is accompanied by five or more symptoms-including feelings of 

sadness, hopelessness, pessimism and a general loss of interest in life-that hinder a person's ability to carry out normal, 

everyday activities.    
        The reviewers also found that, during the first year following a heart attack, those with major depression can have a 

delay in returning to work, worse quality of life, and worse physical and psychological health. In fact, some studies show 

that depression that begins while the patient is hospitalized can continue to affect his or her psychological and physical 

health for as long as 5 years after discharge. Approximately 765,000 Americans were discharged following treatment for heart 

attacks in 2002, according to national hospital data from AHRQ.    
        ""This report provides the scientific evidence clinicians need to know about the prevalence of depression in heart 

attack survivors, how depression affects these patients, and the need to treat the disease early,"" said AHRQ Director Carolyn 

M. Clancy, M.D.    
The American Academy of Family Physicians, which requested the evidence review, plans to use the report to develop 

evidence-based clinical practice guidelines.    
        The reviewers found strong evidence that both counseling and certain  antidepressants , such as selective  serotonin  

reuptake inhibitors, are effective at reducing symptoms of depression in patients following a heart attack, but there is no 

evidence that either therapy reduces the likelihood of suffering future cardiac events or the odds of dying from them. 

   
Reviewers of the AHRQ-supported Johns Hopkins University Evidence-Based Practice Center in Baltimore, led by David E. Bush, 

M.D., and Roy C. Ziegelstein, M.D., could not conclude whether the frequency of needing prescription medicines for cardiac 

problems or cardiac procedures is influenced by depression. However, they did find relatively strong evidence that patients 

with post-heart attack depression are less likely than other heart attack survivors to take their medications as instructed 

or to follow doctors' advice for helping to prevent future heart attacks by losing weight, reducing salt consumption or 

exercising, for example.    
The reviewers found insufficient evidence to adequately assess the performance of methods used to screen patients for 

depression while patients are hospitalized for heart attack. However, the review also found that most of the commonly used 

screening instruments and rating scales are accurate enough to identify depression when used within 3 months after the 

patient's initial hospitalization for heart attack.    
The reviewers called for additional research to expand the evidence base, including studies to determine the major causes of 

death among depressed post-heart attack patients, whether treatment improves their outcomes relative to similar patients not 

suffering from depression and the definition of the most clinically relevant measure of depression during initial heart 

attack hospitalization.    
Details are in Evidence Report on Post-Myocardial Infarction Depression. The summary is on AHRQ's Web site at  ahrq.gov/clinic/epcsums/midepsum.htm , and the full

Teenagers suffering from  depression  may have abnormal brain structure, according to new research. An article published in BMC Medicine this week shows that adolescents diagnosed with major depressive disorder tend to have a small hippocampus - a part of the brain associated with motivation, emotion, and memory formation.    

Researchers from Dalhousie University and the National Research Council of Canada studied 34 adolescents between the ages of 13 to 18 years old, half of whom were suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD).    Using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) they scanned each volunteer's brain and measured the volume of their left and right hippocampuses. 
   
The hippocampus of patients with MDD was, on average, 17% smaller than that of controls. The size difference was particularly evident in the left hippocampus, where the average volume was 2.53cm3 in patients with depression and 3.05 cm3 in those without. 
   
The authors, Frank MacMaster and Vivek Kusumakar, write: 'To our knowledge this is the first published report regarding hippocampal volume in youths with early onset depression compared to healthy controls.' 
   
MDD is a severe, common and debilitating illness that is as common in adolescence as it is in adulthood. By studying younger patients the researchers hoped that they would be able to see differences in brain structure that may cause the disorder, rather than those differences that are a side effect of long-term illness or treatment. 
   
The reduced size of the brain structure was not a side effect of the treatment, as patients who were not yet being treated for MDD also had small left hippocampuses compared to controls.    The study also showed that people that had suffered from MDD for longer had larger hippocampuses than the more recently diagnosed patients. This suggests that in studies of adult patients, who are long-term sufferers of MDD, the initial difference in hippocampus size may not show up. 
   
'These conclusions should be considered preliminary, considering the small sample sizes used,' write the authors. They plan to carry out experiments that use larger sample sizes to confirm these initial findings. They also plan to look more closely at how the size of the hippocampus varies with the progression of major depressive disorder.

Among men without  heart disease  but who have significant cardiac risk factors, a poor performance on an exercise treadmill test is associated with more than doubling of the risk for a  heart attack  or other  coronary heart disease  event, according to a report in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association.    
Exercise treadmill testing is not generally recommended as routine screening for people with no history or symptoms of heart disease. This is the first study to evaluate exercise testing among asymptomatic people relative to their predicted coronary heart disease (CHD) risk using the Framingham risk score. 
   
The Framingham Risk Score assigns point values to risk factors such as  high blood pressure , total  cholesterol , HDL cholesterol, age,  diabetes  and smoking history to predict the risk of an event such as chest pain, heart attack or coronary death over a 10-year period. A risk score of 9 percent or less is considered low risk, 10 percent to 19 percent is considered intermediate risk, while a score of more than 20 percent, meaning that the person has a one in five chance of an event in 10 years, is classified as high risk.    

""Our results suggest that exercise testing may be of benefit in asymptomatic men with intermediate to high risk,"" said Gary J. Balady, M.D., a professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine and an investigator with the Framingham Heart Study.    

He and colleagues found that a change in electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing called ST-segment  depression  or failure to reach target heart rate during exercise testing more than doubled the 10-year risk of coronary event in men with high Framingham risk, compared to those who did not have these findings on the  stress  test.    

But increased exercise capacity predicted lower CHD risk in the high-risk men.    

""Greater exercise tolerance as measured in metabolic equivalents (METS) had a lower 10 year event rate,"" he said. Each MET increase, which is a multiple of the resting metabolic rate, was associated with a 13 percent decrease in risk of coronary event.    

The study did not provide evidence to support exercise testing for asymptomatic women because the event rate in women was too low to suggest any significant correlations between the exercise results and future events, he said.    

All study participants were asymptomatic at baseline. The study included 1,431 male and 1,612 female Framingham Heart Study participants. Their average age at baseline was 45 and the participants were followed for more than 18 years.    

During follow-up, 224 men (15.7 percent) developed a coronary event such as chest pain, heart attack or died from CHD.    

Balady said that high-risk men who have ST-segment depression or fail to achieve target heart rate on the exercise treadmill test ""should get maximum risk reduction. That means aggressive  blood pressure  and lipid control, and of course, we want everyone to stop smoking."" Also, among these patients it would be prudent to consider additional diagnostic tests to determine the extent of disease, which may include imaging stress tests or invasive procedures such as angiography to assess the condition of arteries and locate any blocked or narrowed vessels.    

However, he said it is important to note that this study did not find that exercise testing provided additional prognostic information in those with 10-year-CHD risk less than 10 percent. The authors conclude that clinicians should consider the global cardiac risk, using the Framingham Risk Score, prior to ordering an exercise tolerance test in asymptomatic men without known heart disease.

Some women who eat certain high-carbohydrates in abundance could be at an increased risk of colecteral  cancer  (Journal of the National Cancer Institute).    
Foods, such as cakes, cookies and high GI products (GI = Glycemic Index) bring about a sudden surge in blood sugar.  This prompts the body to produce high amounts of  insulin .    
Insulin helps convert the sugar (glucose) into energy.  Insulin stimulates cells to divide, it keeps them alive for longer than normal.  This phenomenon could encourage the growth of tumors (UK spelling ? tumours).    
The study monitored more than 38,000 women for about eight years.  174 had colecteral cancer.    
The women who were on a high glycemic foods diet were over two times as likely to develop colecteral cancer (than those who were not).    
The study was carried out at the Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women?s Hospital in Boston (both in USA).    
The experts were intrigued by the results.    
'You may pay for that sugar high in more ways than you realize,' said Michael Thun, head of epidemiologic research for the American Cancer Society.  He went on to say that more studies were needed.

Women report that current system is unsatisfactory   

Hamburg, Germany: Women who have been treated for  breast cancer  find follow-up visits to their oncologists unsatisfactory and not reassuring, according to research carried out in Sweden. 
   Ingrid K?ssler, president of the Swedish Association of Breast Cancer Societies, told the 4th European Breast Cancer Conference in Hamburg today (Thursday 18 March) that the format of follow-up visits needed to be changed and that research should be carried out into the efficacy of specialist nurses conducting the follow-ups. 
   
Ms K?ssler sent questionnaires to 1,200 members of three different local breast cancer organizations within the Swedish Breast Cancer Association, and also distributed it to participants in an Internet discussion forum. She received over 600 replies. 
   
'The majority of the women preferred to go to a breast centre for follow-up visits rather than to their GP,' said Ms K?ssler.    'However, they indicated that the follow-up examinations were hurried, investigations were not reassuring and some women reported a lack of continuity as they saw different oncologists at each visit. Many women felt there was no opportunity to ask questions, express emotional concerns or talk about their social situation. 
   
'Other research has found that 70 to 80 per cent of recurrences have been detected by the patients themselves and this casts doubt on the effectiveness of follow-up visits with oncologists and surgeons and the use of routine investigations. 
   
'It is important that the follow-up visits are changed to meet patients' ongoing needs better.' 
   
The rationale behind follow-up visits after primary treatment for breast cancer is that early detection of a recurrence leads to a better outcome, that women get a sense of psychological security and satisfaction from the visit, and that the data collected are useful for quality assurance.    However, the visits are expensive and Ms K?ssler said that if they are also ineffective in achieving their aims, a more efficient and cost-effective system needed to be put in place. 
   
'Women who answered the survey said that they wanted more time for discussion and questions, and they wanted to see the same person at each visit,' she said. 
   
'The growing number of women diagnosed with breast cancer, in combination with improved treatment, increases the socio-economic burden of the disease. It is possible that if specially trained breast cancer nurses conducted the follow-ups, this could result in increased satisfaction among the breast cancer patients and a decreased cost of care. 
   
'Although Sweden and other countries are conducting studies comparing nurse-led with conventional medical follow-up visits, we need more studies and trials to provide evidence-based information before we decide to change.'

There were fewer deaths from  cancer  across Europe in 2000 than had experts had predicted, it has been revealed.    
Around 92,500 fewer people died of the disease than had been calculated by scientists in the mid-1980s. 
   
Experts had said deaths would rise to over 1.03 million. 
   
But they now say the figure is likely to be closer to 940,500.
   
In an attempt to reduce the number of deaths from the disease, the Europe Against Cancer Programme set a target in 1985 for each country in the European Union to cut cancer deaths by 15% by the year 2000. 
   
Only Finland and Austria have achieved the target for both men and women, although other countries - including the UK - did meet the target for men. 
   
 Lung cancer 
   
Overall in the EU, there was a 10% reduction in the number of deaths expected among men and an 8% reduction among women. 
   
Luxembourg and Finland saw the biggest reduction compared to expected deaths in men, down by 24% and 17% respectively. 
   
But in Portugal and Greece, there were more cancer deaths than predicted among both men and women. 
   
The figures show there were fewer deaths from stomach, colorectal and  breast cancers  than expected. 
   
But, although there were fewer deaths from lung cancer among men than had been feared, the rates in women increased in all countries. 
   
The increased ranged from 8% in the UK to 84% in the Netherlands. 
   
The risk of dying from  prostate cancer  was increased in all EU countries except France, Italy, Luxembourg and Germany. 
   
The researchers compiled information on deaths from cancer from EU countries, and examines the trends in common cancers such as lung, stomach, colorectal, breast and prostate. 
   
Stabilising 
   
Professor Peter Boyle, Director of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy, who led the research, said: 'With few exceptions most countries are experiencing declining trends in cancer death rates, which seem set to continue, at least in the near future.' 
   
He said smoking had a major impact on cancer rates. 
   
'Successful tobacco control activities have made a major contribution to the declines in cancer death rates in men and the UK is a good example of this.' 
   
But he added: 'The risk of dying from lung cancer in women increased substantially in every country, although it appears to be stabilising in the UK. 
   
'The failure of tobacco control in women is a great disappointment. 
   
'The fact that women are increasingly smoking, and smoking more, represents a great failure of public health in the recent past and is a major challenge for the near future. 
   
'If women in each country had experienced the same decline in lung cancer as men, then the target may have been achieved in women and also overall.' 
   
He added: 'What this research tells us is that tobacco control must continue to be a number one priority, and women, alongside deprived populations of both sexes, must be a priority target.' 
   
Cancer control 
   
A spokesman for Cancer Research UK: 'It is very encouraging to see an overall drop in cancer deaths across Europe. 
   
'On the downside, the blanket rise in female deaths from lung cancer is a tragic warning to those countries whose young women are smoking in ever-increasing numbers, particularly Greece, Portugal, France, Spain and most Eastern European countries.

Brochures and web-based information that individuals access independently may help them make appropriate decisions about  cancer  screening, says a report by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services in the January 2004 issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.    This type of information is increasingly needed because the science related to cancer screening is difficult to communicate in an office visit, and many persons at high risk don?t have regular health care and must make decisions on their own. 
   
The review showed that brochures and web information may help individuals make informed decisions about whether and when to be screened and the type of screening when multiple choices are available. 

   ?We know that making decisions about cancer screening can be difficult for individuals and their families,? said Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).    ?These findings from the Task Force provide important insight about how public health can communicate effectively about the risks, benefits and other outcomes associated with screening.? 
   
The task force reviewed interventions designed to help people make specific choices among options (including not being screened or deferring the decision).    The review produced evidence that interventions generally led to increased knowledge about cancers and their associated screening tests.    The review did not determine whether such strategies could help patients participate in decision making at the level they desire, result in decisions that are consistent with patient values and preferences, or improve screening rates. 
   
The authors note that while screening tests are available for many types of cancers, the effectiveness of screening for all types of cancer has not been proven. 
   
The findings are the result of a systematic review of the literature on informed decision- making interventions conducted by the independent Task Force on Community Preventive Services, which is supported by the CDC. 
   
Informed decision making occurs when individuals have enough information about a disease, the screening test for it, and their personal risk level to make a choice that reflects their preferences and values, and allows them to participate in decision making at the level they choose. 
   
The Task Force on Community Preventive Services, established in 1996, is the community-based counterpart to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, considered the gold standard for clinical preventive services.    

The Task Force releases its findings to a wide variety of public health decision makers as the Guide to Community Preventive Services. To date, 88 Community Guide findings have been published, providing new guidance for public health leaders making decisions about the application of limited public health resources.

Included in the same issue of the journal is an article on shared decision-making interventions from the US Preventive Services Task Force, which is supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and an editorial discussing the findings of the two reviews.

Less than half of Asian Americans who ought to be screened for type 2 diabetes actually get tested, according to a study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. Asian Americans have a high prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes. Yet they were the racial and ethnic group least likely, by far, to undergo recommended screening.

A team of University of Chicago researchers found that only 47.1 percent of Asian Americans received appropriate screening, compared to 60.2 percent of non-Hispanic blacks, 59.2 percent of non-Hispanic whites, 58.8 percent of multiracial adults, 58.1 percent of Hispanics, 55.6 percent of American Indians or Alaskan Natives and 50.3 percent of Pacific Islanders.

""Even after accounting for education, access to healthcare and other key factors, Asian Americans had 34 percent lower odds of being screened compared to non-Hispanic whites,"" said the study's lead author, Elizabeth Tung, MD, clinical instructor of medicine at the University of Chicago. ""This may be an important driver of undiagnosed diabetes in this group.""

The researchers analyzed data from the 2012-14 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, an annual telephone survey that collects information on health risks and preventive behaviors of United States residents. Their sample included 526,000 respondents, including 9,310 Asian Americans, who met the criteria for diabetes screening.

""Asian Americans are not necessarily averse to screening tests,"" said Tung. The researchers examined a subgroup of Asian Americans who completed both breast and colon cancer screening, and the lower rates of diabetes screening persisted. Both breast and colon cancer screening are ""logistically and technically more involved than diabetes screening,"" the researchers note.

The authors of the study were concerned that many Asian patients and some of their physicians may not be fully aware that - even at lower body weights - Asians are at high risk for type 2 diabetes. About 21 percent of Asian Americans have type 2 diabetes, nearly double the rate for non-Hispanic whites. Undiagnosed diabetes is almost three times higher among Asian Americans.

Recognizing this increased risk, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) revised its screening guidelines for Asian Americans last year. They formerly recommended that Asian Americans should be screened if they were at least 45 years old. Overweight adults, those with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or more, should be screened even if they were younger than 45.

In 2015, the ADA changed their guidelines to recommend screening for Asian Americans with a BMI of 23 or higher.

""Asian Americans should confirm with their doctors that they have been screened for diabetes,"" Tung said. ""Doctors shouldn't neglect to screen Asian Americans just because they appear to be thin.""

The study has several limitations, the authors note. Asian Americans in their study had higher educational attainment and were more fluent in English than the general population, which may have reduced barriers to accessing healthcare and the extent of the disparity. Their data source covers only 42 of the 50 United States, excluding California and Texas, the states with largest Asian populations. Additionally, the data about diabetes, breast cancer and colon cancer screening was based on self-reported information by those interviewed, which was not subject to external validation.

The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Agency for Healthcare Research Quality, and the Chicago Center for Diabetes Translation Research. Additional authors were Arshiya Baig, Elbert Huang, Neda Laiteerapong and Kao-Ping Chua.

Children should be given more support to enable them to be more active during the winter, particularly at weekends, say researchers from the University of Cambridge. Their call comes in response to their findings that children are less active and spend more time sitting in autumn and winter compared to other times of the year.

Public health guidelines state that children should accumulate at least an hour per day of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity, which might include brisk walking or running, active participation in sports or exercising. At the same time, children should minimise the amount of time they spend sitting for extended periods.

To examine the seasonal variation in children's behaviour, researchers at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit and Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR) at the University of Cambridge used data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, which measured levels of physical activity in more than 700 seven year old children across a calendar year using accelerometers. Using the data, they also modelled the relationship between levels of activity and variables such as gender, weight and family income. The results of their study are published in the journal Medicine & Science in Exercise & Sport.

The researchers found that physical activity was lower in autumn and winter compared to spring; average activity levels across the group peaked in April at 65.3 min/day and reached their lowest levels in February at 47.8 min/day. Physical activity was at its lowest at weekends during winter. Children were at their most active during early summer, particularly at weekends.

The models suggested that boys' activity levels changed more than girls' throughout the year, but remained higher than girls' at all times.  Although on average, boys achieved the recommended minimum activity even at winter, girls only tended to reach recommended levels during the summer.

""Physical activity is important for children's health and development, but many do not get enough exercise,"" says the study's first author Dr Andrew Atkin, from the MRC Epidemiology Unit and CEDAR. ""During spring and summer, when the weather is better and the days are longer, they tend to be playing out and more active, but during the darker, colder months, they are much less active.""

The team argues that the findings provide further support for initiatives aimed at encouraging physical activity amongst children during winter, particularly at the weekend. To some extent, the structure of the school day, including the need to travel to and from school, protects against inactivity during weekdays in term time.

""Children need to be given more opportunities to be active, particularly during the winter months and when the weather is bad,"" adds Dr Esther van Sluijs, the study's senior author also from CEDAR. ""This might include better access to indoor spaces where children can be active or through schools changing their policies related to the use of indoor and outdoor spaces during bad weather.""

The study was largely supported by the UK Clinical Research Collaboration, whose funding comes from the British Heart Foundation, Department of Health, Economic and Social Research Council, Medical Research Council, and the Wellcome Trust. The Millennium Cohort Study was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.",0

Surviving  cancer  in childhood can lead to health problems later in life, according to a study.    
Researchers found nearly half go on to develop at least one fairly significant health problem linked to their cancer, or its treatment. 
   
A team from UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas examined the medical records of nearly 10,000 childhood cancer survivors. 
   
Their work is published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
   
The researchers also found that girls were 40% more likely than boys to suffer long-term problems. 
   
Long-term effects of therapy can include secondary cancers, heart and lung disease,  infertility ,  obesity ,  hypertension  and disruption of the hormone system. 
   
Almost 20% of survivors showed signs of psychological distress. 
   
The researchers hope their work will lead to improved monitoring of cancer survivors as they grow older. 
   
Survival rates for childhood cancer are now approaching 80% - meaning that many more people go on to adulthood. 
   
Damage 
   
Researcher Professor Kevin Oeffinger said: 'Virtually all organ systems can be affected by radiation,  chemotherapy  or surgery, leading to a wide array of potential effects later in life. 
   
'This study tells us that children who survive cancer need to be periodically evaluated for the rest of their lives. 
   
'We hope physicians become more aware of the risks and are cognizant of the problems survivors face.' 
   
The study focused on cancer survivors who were treated between 1970 and 1986 and were 21 years of age or younger at the time of their diagnosis. 
   
Professor George Buchanan, who also worked on the study, said many of the long-term effects from modern cancer therapy are subtler than side effects seen years ago. 
   
'It used to be in the old days that physicians were simply gratified to see their young cancer patients survive, but as the patients started living longer we began to see side effects from the new therapies that were helping them live. 
   
'And we've only had modern cancer therapy for the last 30 years, meaning we're still learning about these side effects every day.' ",0
61,272257,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/314362.php,Study supports lower cut-off point for defining prediabetes,Diabetes,Diabetes,,,,3,3,1,5,3,3,4,1,2,,,,,,,,,,"
The health risks and mortality associated with prediabetes seem to increase at the lower cut-off point for blood sugar levels recommended by some guidelines, finds a large study published in The BMJ.

Prediabetes is a ""pre-diagnosis"" of diabetes - when a person's blood glucose level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered diabetes. If left untreated, prediabetes can develop into type 2 diabetes. An estimated 79 million people in the US and 7 million people in the UK are thought to be affected.

Doctors define prediabetes as impaired fasting glucose (higher than normal blood sugar levels after a period of fasting), impaired glucose tolerance (higher than normal blood sugar levels after eating), or raised haemoglobin levels.

But the cut-off points vary across different guidelines and remain controversial.

For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) defines prediabetes as fasting plasma glucose of 6.1-6.9 mmol/L, while the 2003 American Diabetes Association (ADA) guideline recommends a cut-off point of 5.6-6.9 mmol/L.

Results of studies on the association between prediabetes and risk of cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality are also inconsistent. Furthermore, whether raised haemoglobin levels for defining prediabetes is useful for predicting future cardiovascular disease is unclear.

So a team of researchers from the affiliated Hospital at Shunde, Southern Medical University in China analysed the results of 53 studies involving over 1.6 million individuals to shed more light on associations between different definitions of prediabetes and the risk of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, and all cause mortality.

They found that prediabetes, defined as impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance, was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality.

The risk increased in people with a fasting glucose concentration as low as 5.6 mmol/L - the lower cut-off point according to ADA criteria.

Raised haemoglobin levels were also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease, but not with an increased risk of stroke and all cause mortality.

The authors point to some study limitations that could have influenced their results, and say pulling observational evidence together in a systematic review and meta-analysis is a good way to consider all the evidence at once, ""but we cannot make statements about cause and effect. We would need to look at experimental evidence for that.""

However, they say their findings ""strongly support"" the lower cut-off point for impaired fasting glucose and raised haemoglobin levels proposed by the ADA guideline.

And they conclude that lifestyle change - eating a healthy balanced diet, keeping weight under control, and doing regular physical activity - is the most effective treatment.

Green tea's ability to fight  cancer  is even more potent and varied than scientists suspected, research suggests.    
Scientists already know that  green tea  contains anti-oxidants which may have a protective effect against cancer. 
   
But now they have discovered that chemicals in the tea also shut down a key molecule which can play a significant role in the development of cancer. 
   
The molecule, known as the aryl hydrocarbon (AH) receptor, has the ability to activate genes - but not always in a positive way. 
   
Tobacco smoke and dioxins, in particular, disrupt the functioning of the molecule and cause it to trigger potentially harmful gene activity. 
   
The researchers, from Rochester University, found that two chemicals in green tea inhibit AH activity. 
   
Similar compounds 
   
Both chemicals are similar to compounds called flavonoids, which are found in broccoli, cabbage, grapes and red wine, and which are also known to help prevent cancer. 
   
Researcher Professor Thomas Gasiewicz said: 'Green tea may work differently than we thought to exert its anti-cancer activity. 
   
'It's likely that the compounds in green tea act through many different pathways.' 
   
The Rochester team showed that the chemicals shut down the AH receptor in cancerous mouse cells. 
   
Early results indicate the same is true in human cells. 
   
However, the scientists say that the results in the laboratory do not necessarily translate to everyday life as the crucial factor is how green tea is broken down inside the body. 
   
In addition, there are a lot of differences between various types of green tea. 
   
Dr Julie Sharp, a science information office at Cancer Research UK, said: 'This research describes additional properties of green tea that may be beneficial but which have yet to be tested properly. 
   
'The causes of cancer are complex and both diet and our genetic make-up act together to influence our risk of developing the disease. 
   
'Cancer Research UK is currently involved in a large-scale study of diet and health that is researching the eating habits of over half a million people in 10 European countries to try and help unravel this complexity.' 
   
Research has also suggested that green tea may help to reduce the risk of  rheumatoid arthritis  and to lower  cholesterol  levels. 
   
The research is published in the journal Chemical Research in Toxicology. ",0

Short, intense courses of  radiotherapy  are more effective in treating head and neck  cancer , scientists have found.   
Giving patients six sessions a week instead of five improved the management of their tumours. 
   
In addition, patients with  laryngeal cancer  were more likely to conserve their voices if they had the faster treatment. 
   
The study of almost 1,500 patients was presented to the European Cancer Conference in Copenhagen. 
   
Scientists from the Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark, gave patients either five or six sessions per week, administering the same dose overall to each patient. 
   
When patients were examined five years after the treatment, it was found tumours were better controlled in those who had received six treatments per week. 
   
Accelerated radiotherapy was also linked to a small increase in survival rates compared with those given five treatments per week. 
   
Patients were more likely to be ill if they were given the more intensive course of treatment, although they recovered quickly. 
   
'No shades of grey' 
   
Professor Jens Overgaard said: 'Although all patients in the accelerated treatment arm did better, some did better than others, and we are currently trying to identify those groups where the benefit is largest. ' 
   
But he said there was no doubt about the benefits of the more intensive treatment: 'There are no shades of grey. 
   
'These findings are unequivocal - accelerated treatment is definitely better in this cancer, both in terms of disease-specific survival and in quality of life.' 
   
Professor Michele Saunders of Cancer Research UK said: 'This accelerated radiotherapy protocol is already being used in the UK and will be the subject of a randomised controlled trial to be organised by the National Cancer Research Institute.'

Fish farmed or caught near the world's great industrial growth areas run the risk of spreading toxic contamination up the food chain and poisoning consumers.

The warning is from one of the world's leading toxicologists, Professor Ming-Hung Wong of the Hong Kong Institute of Education, following a review of scientific investigations into food chain contamination and human disease in the Pearl River Delta region of southern China.

Prof. Wong will report the results of his review at CleanUp 2015, the 6th International Contaminated Site Remediation Conference, Melbourne.

""Food safety is currently one of the major public health issues in the world - and 'chemical food contaminants' are among the three key global food safety concerns,"" he says.

""The Pearl River Delta (PRD) region typifies the rapid industrialisation that is taking place in many regions around the world. Its waters are affected by mining in the catchment, but overuse of antibiotics and drugs by the populace, by industrial discharges containing heavy metals like arsenic, cadmium and mercury, toxic chemicals and hydrocarbons.

""As a result, a wide range of toxins find their way into food production systems. Most of the fish consumed in the PRD are farmed fish, which are highly susceptible to toxic chemicals discharged nearby. Seaborne plastic residues commonly found inshore act as magnets that absorb toxic chemicals, and subsequently transfer to fish. Feeding farmed fish with contaminated trash (less desirable) fish and fishmeal (commonly derived from trash fish) also contributes to adverse human health effects.

""At the same time hazardous chemical chains are set in motion, as when mercury is released by coal combustion, reaches the sediment beneath fish farming rafts and is then transformed by sulphide bacteria into organic mercury, which is far more toxic both to people and to fish.""

Prof. Wong says scientists are finding numerous disturbing health signs among consumers who eat a lot of fish. For example children in Hong Kong have high mercury concentrations in their hair, as a result of their diet. 

Other Chinese scientists report a possible link between high levels of mercury and cadmium and autism in children from coastal populations, whose diets rely on fish and shellfish. Children living further inland, by contrast, had higher levels of arsenic and lead, due to the effects of industrial pollution on food crops and livestock.

Studies conducted with the help of the Red Cross find that the Hong Kong general public has high blood mercury levels. Residents of fish farming villages had high mercury levels in their hair, reflecting their rates of seafood consumption. Women with uterine cancers had higher concentrations of persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals in their fatty tissues, also linked to a seafood diet.

Uncontrolled recycling of electronic wastes also emits a wide range of toxic chemicals leading to high body loadings of different toxic chemicals - such as flame retardants - among workers and residents of major e-waste recycling sites like Guiyu and Taizhou in China, due to their dietary intakes, he says.

""As a result of this dietary poisoning, common health problems such as cancers, nerve damage and lower intelligence, kidney and lung diseases and bone disorders are becoming increasingly serious issues in newly industrialising countries,"" Prof. Wong says.

However, he cautions, the export of contaminated foodstuffs, industrial products, polluted air and water from these heavily industrialised regions may also be posing greater risks for consumers and inhabitants of less polluted regions and countries as world trade expands.

Prof. Wong concludes by issuing an urgent call to establish a list of toxic chemicals, their sources, fates and environmental and health impacts for the Asian Region as a first step in attempting to prevent the widespread poisoning of consumers.

""In addition, the practice of 'green aquaculture' (explained in his talk) is necessary to ensure quality and safe seafood products,"" he adds.",0

Major depressive disorder is a recurrent disease. Brief cognitive therapy (CT), added to either regular care or medication, is helpful in preventing relapse/recurrence. Little is known which type of persons benefit from preventive CT, the so called \'aptitude treatment interaction\' effect. This issue was addressed in the July issue of Psychother Psychosom. The cohort included exclusively patients with at least two previous episodes remitted on various types of treatments (n = 172). They were assessed within a clinical trial comparing treatment as usual (TAU) with preventive CT added to TAU. Differential demographic, illness-related, psychological and biological risk factors in postponing recurrence by preventive CT were examined. Significant aptitude-treatment-interaction effects were found for the number of previous episodes, daily hassles and life events, avoidant coping, gender, and morning cortisol levels.    

Preventive CT seemed ineffective in patients with life events (as more frequently reported by women in our study) and in patients with high episode number characterized by higher levels of avoidant coping. Generic predictors indicate that in CT, as in TAU, patients with more residual depressive symptomatology and higher levels of dysfunctional attitudes profit less from preventive CT. The finding that preventive CT protects against the influence of a consistently found risk factor of relapse/recurrence, i.e. the number of depressive episodes, underlines the potential of psychological preventive interventions. Preventive CT seemed to be especially effective in reducing presumably internally provoked, relapse/recurrence but may be quite ineffective in reducing externally provoked relapse/recurrence. CT possibly prevents either  stress  generation or disrupts kindling effects. Kindling effects probably cannot be disrupted in patients with higher levels of avoidant coping who experienced a high number of episodes, and patients who experienced life events.

The daily routines of one in ten American in Vermont, Alaska, Maine and other northern states will change for the worse on Oct. 30.    

The alterations start every year around October just after the end of daylight savings time. For most, the clock shift just adds an hour to the weekend -- but for sufferers of  seasonal affective disorder , a syndrome involving recurring bouts of  depression  during fall and winter months, it marks the beginning of a difficult time of year when many forgo an after-work run for a nap, watch television instead of walk the dog, or sleep later in the morning.    

With this year's turning back of the clock, the 14.5 million Americans susceptible to SAD may begin feeling fatigued, worthless, disinterested, even suicidal.    

Many will receive treatment involving sitting in front of a light box for an hour or two a day in hopes that the white fluorescent or full-spectrum light will simulate sunlight and make them feel better.    

The treatment works reasonably well but is hard to stick with, so Kelly Rohan, a SAD expert and assistant professor of psychology at the University of Vermont, views it as more a quick fix than long-term solution.    

She is currently exploring treatment through cognitive-behavioral therapy, a commonly used form of ""talk therapy"" that has been used for non-seasonal depression since the 1960s, with SAD patients.    

She thinks this is the first time this type of therapy has been deployed to treat SAD, and the results in early research and clinical trials are promising.    

In a 2005 study involving 61 patients, Rohan treated one group with daily light therapy, another with 12 sessions of  CBT  and a third group with a combination of both treatments. A less popular option -- selective  serotonin  reuptake inhibitors -- wasn't used.    

Rohan's findings, which will be published later this year as a follow-up to a 2004 study that appeared in the June issue of Journal of Affective Disorders, show that all three groups showed comparable improvement across the six weeks of study treatment compared to a wait-list control group.    

In addition, the largest percentage of patients (80 percent) responded in full when CBT and light therapy were combined. Furthermore, those who underwent CBT -- both alone and with light therapy -- were less depressed at the one-year follow-up compared to patients who had been treated with light therapy alone.    

Only six percent of the CBT participants met the criteria for depression at the one-year follow-up, while 40 percent of light-exclusive participants met the depression criteria during the winter season of the next year. 

The majority of light therapy users reported having a hard time adhering to the recommended twice-daily 45-minute light box sessions at the end of six weeks of study treatment.    

Rohan's research offers compelling evidence that CBT talk therapy by itself may be an effective treatment for SAD and may offer some long-term benefits over light therapy.
   
""Sitting in front of a light box every day of the fall and winter promotes sedentary behavior and is hard for people to maintain over time,"" she says.    

""Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a time-limited treatment and appears to have better long-term effects.""    

The cause of SAD, first noted as far back as 1845 but officially named in the 1980s, has been attributed to a biochemical imbalance in the hypothalamus due to the shortening of daylight hours and the lack of sunlight in winter. The theory goes that as seasons change there is a shift in people's ""biological internal clocks"" or circadian rhythm, due in part to changes in sunlight patterns.    

Because of this, incidence of SAD varies by locale, with rates ranging from one percent in Florida to 10 percent in Vermont, Alaska and Orono, Maine, where Rohan first became interested in SAD while working on her doctorate in clinical psychology.    

The condition ranges in intensity from not being able to function normally without continuous medical treatment to a mildly debilitating case of ""winter blues.""    

It seemed to Rohan, who came to UVM earlier this fall after spending five years as an assistant professor of medical and clinical psychology at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, that cognitive-behavioral therapy was an obvious way to treat SAD, despite it never being used before.    

""As far as I know we're the first group to apply it to SAD,"" she says. ""Some people would argue that SAD is a purely biological kind of depression, so any type of psychological treatment such as CBT shouldn't work, but it does. I think it's good news that there appears to be more than one way to intervene and improve winter depression.""    

During the therapy, which occurs twice a week for six weeks, Rohan teaches patients about the origins of SAD and how learned behaviors and ingrained negative thought patterns contribute to their symptoms.    

She also encourages patients to act more like they do in the summer and continue regular activity. She says it doesn't necessarily have to be an outdoor activity like skiing, just something that keeps people active and engaged during the fall and winter months.    

One SAD patient was an artist, for example, who tended not to have time in the summer to work on her art. ""We started having her do more art in the winter. It gave her something to look forward to,"" Rohan says. ""The key is to limit hibernating and develop some winter interests.""    

Disproving light therapy as a form of treatment isn't Rohan's goal. Instead she hopes to show its shortcomings and offer an alternative that is easier to comply with in the long run, has more lasting effects and teaches lifelong coping skills.    

""Before investing in a light box, I encourage SAD patients to go for a 30-minute walk after sunrise every morning. This gets just as much light to the retina as using light therapy and has the added benefit of increasing physical activity,"" she says.    

""The time change is a bear; just the thought of winter can be enough to trigger symptoms. We encourage people to do whatever it is they get enjoyment out of and to recognize the symptoms early so they can deal with them before they become unmanageable.""

According to widely reported community-based research, almost half the U.S. population suffers from  depression . But research by two sociologists indicates that percentage is greatly exaggerated or is a misrepresentation.
   
The extraordinarily high rates of untreated mental illness reported by community studies are false, say Allan V. Horwitz, a sociology professor in the Institute of Health at Rutgers University, and Jerome Wakefield, a professor in the School of Social Work at New York University. Community studies rely on standard, closed-format questions about symptoms with no context provided to differentiate between reactions to normal life  stress  (i.e., a death, a romantic break up, work or school stress) and pathological conditions that indicate clinical mental illness.
   
\""These numbers are largely a product of survey methodologies that, by nature, overstate the number of people with mental illness.\"" Reporting the findings in Contexts magazine (Winter 2006), published by the American Sociological Association, the authors state, \""Moreover, because people experiencing normal reactions to stressful events are less likely than the truly disordered to seek medical attention, such questions are bound to inflate estimates of the rate of untreated disorder.\""
   
In the past, diagnoses relied on treatment studies, but it became apparent that the number of treated patients understated the problem for a variety of reasons such as lack of access to treatment and reluctance to seek appropriate help. Today tightly structured questions are used in community studies to allow researchers to better diagnose a population.
   
The problem is that the criteria used in the community surveys are not necessarily valid for diagnosing mental disorders. One reason for this is that people self-select when seeking treatment and use their judgment to decide if their feelings exceed normal responses to stressful events. Second, clinicians make contextual judgments when they diagnose patients because some depressive symptoms might occur as a normal response to a loss of a job or a marriage unraveling. In surveys, interviewers are forbidden to judge the validity of a response or discuss the intent of a question. In addition, the duration criteria of community surveys only require that symptoms last at least two weeks, causing transient and self-correcting problems to be counted as disorders.
   
\""In contrast to clinical settings,\"" say Horwitz and Wakefield, \""symptom-based diagnoses in community studies consider everyone who reports enough symptoms as having the mental disorder of depression. Symptoms that would not require treatment may nevertheless qualify as a disorder in a community survey.\""
   
\""Community surveys could more adequately separate normal responses to stressful situations from mental disorders by including questions about the context in which symptoms develop and persist,\"" say Horwitz and Wakefield. The decision not to include contextual criteria in community surveys, they speculate, might have to do not only with efficiency and practicality but also with resistance to change by groups that benefit from high rates of  mental health  problems.
   
There are a number of reasons that these high rates are perpetuated. One is that political support is more likely for an agency devoted to preventing and treating a widespread disease such as the National Institute of Mental Health. Another reason is that pharmaceutical companies capitalize on these survey findings to broaden their markets. The explosive growth in sales of  antidepressants  may indicate its effectiveness. Lastly, advocacy groups lay claim to the prevalence of mental disorders. They equate the millions of people that surveys identify with disorders with the serious mental disorders in order to reduce the social distance between the mentally disordered and others, thereby lowering the stigma. This may only hinder the truly disabled by shifting resources from where it is truly needed.

First-born children's thinking skills outperform their siblings because they receive more mental stimulation from their parents in their early years, research suggests.
 
First borns score higher than their siblings in IQ tests as early as age one, the study has found.
 
Although all children received the same levels of emotional support, first-born children received more support with tasks that developed thinking skills.
 
Researchers say the findings could help to explain the so-called birth order effect when children born earlier in a family enjoy better wages and more education in later life.
 
Economists at the University of Edinburgh, Analysis Group and the University of Sydney examined data from the U.S. Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, a dataset collected by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 
Nearly 5,000 children were observed from pre-birth to age 14. Every child was assessed every two years. The tests included reading recognition, such as matching letters, naming names and reading single words aloud and picture vocabulary assessments.  Information was also collected on environmental factors such as family background and economic conditions.
 
Researchers applied statistical methods to economic data to analyse how the parental behaviour of the child was related to their test scores. 
 
The researchers then used an assessment tool, the Home Observation Measurement of the Environment, to observe parental behaviour, including pre-birth behaviour, such as, smoking and drinking activity during pregnancy, and post-birth behaviour, such as, mental stimulation and emotional support. 
 
The findings showed that advantages enjoyed by first born siblings start very early in life - from just after birth to three years of age. 

The differences increased slightly with age, and showed up in test scores that measured verbal, reading, math and comprehension abilities.
 
Researchers found that parents changed their behaviour as subsequent children were born. They offered less mental stimulation to younger siblings also took part in fewer activities such as such as reading with the child, crafts and playing musical instruments.
 
Mothers also took higher risks during the pregnancy of latter-born children, such as increased smoking.
 
Dr Ana Nuevo-Chiquero, of the University of Edinburgh's School Economics, said: ""Our results suggests that broad shifts in parental behaviour are a plausible explanation for the observed birth order differences in education and labour market outcomes.""

Hamburg, Germany: A new Canadian study has found that  breast cancer  patients who were treated according to accepted standards of care or who took part in clinical trials were from 30% to 60% less likely to die from any cause during a seven-year follow up period.    
Lead researcher Dr Nicole H?bert-Croteau told the 4th European Breast Cancer Conference today (Friday 19 March) that the findings confirmed the assumption that breast cancer patients benefited from taking part in clinical trials. Treatment in centres that dealt with large numbers of cases was also associated with better survival. 
   
Dr H?bert-Croteau and her team studied 1,727 women with early node-negative breast cancer in five regions of Quebec over a median follow up period of nearly seven years. The regions covered over 60% of the population of the province.    Of the 57 hospitals taking part, 16 were involved in collaborative clinical trials during part or whole of the 1988-1994 study period. Larger centres treated more than 100 women a year with breast cancer, the medium sized centres treated between 50 and 100 and small centres treated fewer than 50. 
   
The overall survival among all the women in the study at seven years was 82%. But, when measured against women in the study who had not been treated according to accepted guidelines and who had not taken part in research, patients whose treatment followed the guidelines had 0.7 times the risk (or 30% less likelihood) of dying from any cause during the follow up period while women who had taken part in research had 0.4 times the risk (or 60% less likelihood) of dying in the follow up period. 
   
Dr H?bert-Croteau, a consultant physician and epidemiologist at the Quebec National Institute of Public Health, said: 'There is some overlap in the confidence intervals of these figures so, from a statistical point of view, the 60% could not be interpreted as being different from the 30%. And of course, the better outcome for women treated in centres with larger caseloads is partly explained by the fact that these centres usually also participate in research and vice versa. 
   
'But what is clear is that, since we adjusted for key prognostic factors among the women, the explanation for the better survival was not due to any baseline characteristics of the patients or to them being selectively chosen to participate in clinical trials.' 
   
She said that the specific strength of the analysis examining participation in clinical trials was that it was population-based and assessed all the breast cancer trials available to women with node-negative breast cancer in Quebec during the study period and had not confined itself to one specific trial protocol or a few.
   
'The lessons from our findings are that women derive substantial benefit from participating in clinical trials and that their gain in survival is at least as great as compliance with current standards of care. It is also clear that the better outcome for patients treated in larger centres is partly explained by these centres' participation in research. Treatment centres should be encouraged to become affiliated to the networks of collaborating institutions so that more patients can share in these benefits.'

Swimming with dolphins is an effective treatment for mild to moderate  depression , say researchers from the University of Leicester in this week's BMJ.    

Their findings support the theory of biophilia, which shows how human health and wellbeing are dependent on our relationships with the natural environment.    

The study was carried out in Honduras and involved 30 patients diagnosed with mild or moderate depression. Half were assigned to the experimental group and half to the control group. 
   
Over a two-week period, participants in the experimental group swam and snorkelled in the water with dolphins for one hour a day. Participants in the control group were assigned to the same water activities, but in the absence of dolphins, to control for the influence of water and the natural setting.    

All participants discontinued  antidepressant  drugs or psychotherapy at least four weeks before entering the study, and were not allowed to take drugs during the study. Depression scores were measured before the study and at the end of treatment. 
   
Although some participants dropped out of the study, the average severity of the depressive symptoms was more reduced in the experimental group than in the control group.    

Animal facilitated therapy with dolphins is more effective than water therapy in treating people with mild to moderate depression, say the authors. Despite some study limitations, the effects exerted by the animals were significantly greater than those of just the natural setting.    

The echolocation system, the aesthetic value, and the emotions raised by the interaction with dolphins may explain the mammals' healing properties, they suggest.    
 
Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Leicester, Professor Mike Reveley, said: \""We were delighted the results were so robust. Anecdotal reports of animal assisted therapy suggested there would be an effect, but this is the first randomised, controlled trial of people with depression diagnosed by strict criteria (ICD-10) using dolphins. There are very few such trials of assisted therapy using any animals.\""    
 
Professor Reveley, who is part of the University\'s Department of Health Sciences, based at Leicester General Hospital, said the effect is probably due to the complex interaction with dolphins, and may well extend to other animals. Further randomised, controlled trials are needed to show this.    
 
Three months after the study, participants in both groups also reported lasting improvement and did not require treatment. This suggests that in patients with mild or moderate depression, using drugs or conventional psychotherapy may not be necessary when biophilic treatment with animals is used, they conclude.    
 
\""Animals,  especially domestic animals, are already used to support people with disability, loneliness, and isolation, but this study suggests that animals may also benefit people with clinical depression. More trials are needed with different animals.    
 
Derived from the Greek, biophilia means literally \'love of life\', and the concept has been developed by biologists to reflect the humans\' natural tendency to affiliate with nature and animals, leading to interactions and positive emotions that result in psychological healing.

Many common illnesses are independently associated with an increased risk of suicide in elderly people, according to an article in the June 14 issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine, one of the JAMA/Archives journals.    
According to information in the article, suicide is the 11th leading cause of death in the United States and is especially common among the elderly. Elderly people in many countries kill themselves at a rate higher than any other segment of the population. Medical illnesses may predispose to suicide, but few studies have examined the association between suicide and specific illnesses, the article states. 
   
David N. Juurlink, M.D., Ph.D., of Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, and colleagues examined the relationship between treatment for several illnesses and the risk of suicide in elderly patients. 
   
The researchers examined the prescription records of all Ontario residents 66 years and older who committed suicide between January 1, 1992 and December 31, 2000. For each resident who committed suicide, the researchers also looked at the prescription records of four living controls matched for age, sex, residential area, and income to determine the presence or absence of 17 illnesses potentially related to suicide. 
   
Among the 1,329 elderly persons who committed suicide (1,012 men; 317 women), the most common methods involved firearms (28 percent), hanging (24 percent), and self-poisoning (21 percent).  Depression ,  bipolar disorder  (manic-depressive illness) and severe pain were associated with the largest increases in suicide risk. However, several other chronic illnesses including seizure disorder, congestive  heart failure , and chronic lung disease, were also associated with an increased risk for suicide. 
   
The researchers also found that treatment for multiple illnesses was strongly related to an increased risk of suicide, and that most of the patients who committed suicide visited a physician in the month before death, about half of them during the preceding week. 
   
""Our findings have important implications for prevention because most elderly patients who commit suicide visit a physician shortly beforehand, and many of them have clinically recognizable features of depression at the time,"" the authors write. ""Physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals should be alert to the possible threat of suicide in elderly patients with chronic illness, particularly in patients with multiple illnesses, symptoms of depression, or other risk factors for suicide.""

Editorial: Preventing Suicide in Elderly Patients    

Eve K. Moscicki, Sc.D., M.P.H., of the National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Md., and Eric D. Caine, M.D., of Rochester, N.Y., write, ""While suicide may seem to many to be a quintessentially individual problem resulting from intensely personal decisions to end one's life, empirical evidence over the past two decades has shifted this view toward one of suicide as a broader, population-based phenomenon with discernible common patterns that can be used to help define generalized risk and protective factors.""    

They write that ""Juurlink et al find that the likelihood of suicide or nonfatal suicidal behaviors increases with an increasing number of risk factors as well as with specific medical conditions such as depression or severe pain. The findings from this epidemiologic work can now form the basis for a different type of study to examine the mechanisms by which depression and general medical disorders may interact.""    

The editorialists state that the findings by Juurlink et al point in three different directions for future research: describing the mechanisms that protect individuals with medical disorders, depression and pain who do not kill themselves; understanding how those who killed themselves appeared in their physician's offices and what a physician should look for; and finally, developing preventive and therapeutic interventions to help those identified as at increased risk for suicide.

A UK expert has said that a screening test which can reveal  prostate cancer  is too unreliable.  He said it should not be recommended to patients.    
In the UK, Prostate Specific Antigen Testing (PSA) is commonly offered to older men (in private healthcare).    
Experts are saying (in the UK) that PSA should not be widely used as it does not seem to clearly benefit patients.    
Men who test positive in these tests have the same prognosis as those whose  cancer  is only spotted when symptoms emerge.    
Prostate cancer can be hard to treat successfully because by the time symptoms arise (in aggressive cases) it has already spread beyond the prostate gland itself.    
The PSA (blood test) seeks a protein that the prostate cells produce.  If levels of this protein are higher than normal, this could indicate either a benign prostate enlargement or the presence of cancer.    
The PSA does not, however, tell you whether you have cancer.  You still have to have a biopsy operation.  Often (after the biopsy) the test is wrong.    
Many older men get prostate cancer.  The problem here is that most of them would die of something else (old age) rather than the prostate cancer.  It is a slow-growing disease.  Many of these men would be better off if left untreated ( stress  here that we are talking about old men).    
A positive PSA test can mean that many cancers which could easily have been left untreated with no ill effects for the man are removed by surgeons, creating unnecessary risk - and a chance of disabling side-effects such as  incontinence  and loss of sexual function.    
A growing number of UK experts are doubtful about whether the PSA test should be given to apparently healthy men.    
Some companies offer the PSA as a matter of course for men over 50.    
Professor Malcolm Law, from the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine in London, wrote in the BMJ that public health authorities should not advocate tests of 'unproven value'.    
He said: 'At present the one certainty about PSA testing is that it causes harm.    
'Some men will receive treatment that is unnecessary - and the treatment will cause incontinence,  impotence  and other complications.    
'In one study over two-thirds of men receiving either radical prostatectomy (surgical prostate removal) or  radiotherapy  were affected.' ",0

Men and women may share more similarities than previously thought when it comes to the risk factors for major  depression , according to a new study by Virginia Commonwealth University researchers.    

In the January issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry, researchers reported that although there is a wide range of risk factors for depression that can act at different stages of development, the patterns of causes of depression for men and women are fairly similar. Some of these risk factors include childhood sexual abuse, poor parent-child relationships, childhood  anxiety  disorders, marital problems, low educational attainment and low social support.    

\""Initially, we thought that the pathway to depression through acting out behaviors such as conduct disorder and drug use and abuse would be significantly more important in men than in women. But we found that there are only very modest differences,\"" said Kenneth S. Kendler, a professor of psychiatry and human genetics in VCU\'s School of Medicine and lead author on the study.    

In 2002, Kendler and his team presented a developmental model to assess major depression in women. Using similar methods, they presented an analogous model to assess depression in men. For this study, approximately 3,000 adult male twins from the Virginia Twin Registry were interviewed twice during a two- to -four-year period. Data collected from this population was compared to the results obtained from the 2002 study on women. The Virginia Twin Registry, now part of the VCU Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry (MATR), contains a population-based record of twins from Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina.    

According to Kendler, one difference observed was that childhood parental loss and low self-esteem were more potent variables in men than in women.    

This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health.    

Kendler collaborated with VCU researchers Charles O. Gardener, Ph.D., and Carol A. Prescott, Ph.D.

74,13782,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/19110.php,Researchers hope monkeys can provide new insights into depression,Depression,Depression,,,,5,1,1,4,3,3,4,4,4,,,,,,,,,,"




The scientists found that depressed female monkeys become socially withdrawn and have reduced body fat, low levels of 

activity, high heart rates and disruptions in hormone levels - all of which are known or suspected characteristics of major 

 depression  in women. Their research is based on female monkeys because women are 66 percent more likely than men to 

experience depression during their lifetimes.    
""We believe these monkeys can be a useful model for learning more about depression in women,"" said Carol Shively, Ph.D., 

professor of pathology at Wake Forest Baptist. ""Current ways to treat depression are only partially successful. This may be 

an important opportunity to develop and test new treatments.""    
She said that with current treatments, there's often a difference between men and women in effectiveness and side effects. 

The animal model will allow scientists to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment specifically in females, the population at 

greatest risk.    
The study involved 36 adult female cynomolgus monkeys, who normally live in social groups in the wild. For most of the 

research, the animals lived in groups of four and their social interactions and behavior were observed. Depressive behavior 

included a slumped or collapsed body posture accompanied by a lack of response to events or objects in the environment in 

which other monkeys were interested.    
The researchers found that the depressed monkeys had suppressed ovarian function, but continued to have menstrual periods. 

Irregular  ovulation  can lead to low  estrogen  levels, which have been associated in both women and monkeys with increased risk 

of disease in the arteries leading to the heart.    
""This suggests the possibility that depressed women may have low ovarian function that goes unnoticed because they still have 

menstrual periods,"" said Shively. ""If this turns out to be accurate, it could explain, in part, the observed relationship 

between  coronary artery disease  and depression.""    
The researchers said monkeys may be particularly useful for learning more about human depression for several reasons. In 

women, depression is often associated with changes in reproduction, including the beginning of menstruation (premenstrual 

syndrome or PMS), pregnancy, the post-partum period and perimenopause. Monkeys have menstrual cycles that are very similar to 

those of women.    
""Further studies of monkeys may inform us about the nature of the relationship between reproductive function and mood in 

females,"" said Shively.    
In addition, depression is higher among people with low levels of education and income. Some female monkeys face social 

 stress  that is similar to the stress that humans with low socioeconomic status experience. In some cases, these monkeys were 

also more prone to depression.    
""What we've observed in these monkeys is the first animal model of social stress-related depression in females,"" said 

Shively.    
In monkeys, the social stress comes from the social hierarchies they naturally form when they live in groups. Monkeys that 

are the low-status or ""subordinate"" animals in the group face more aggression, are more vigilant, spend less time being 

groomed - a friendly behavior by monkey standards - and spend more time alone. Previous research has shown that they have 

increased heart rates, more of the stress hormone cortisol and more cardiovascular disease than dominant monkeys.    
Depressive disorders affect about 19 million Americans yearly. The lifetime prevalence rate of major depression in women is 

21 percent, compared to 12.7 percent for men. Depression in women can have negative effects on children as well as marriage. 

In addition, women who develop depression before age 18 are less likely to obtain a college or graduate degree, reducing 

their future earning potential.

Stressed-out 11-year-olds eat more unhealthful food than their less-anxious classmates and consume fewer nutritious meals and snacks, according to British researchers.    

A study of 4,320 schoolchildren found that they tended to slip into generally unhealthful dietary practices as their lives grew more stressful. Rather than simply overeating in response, they munched more often on bad stuff while ignoring healthy ways to eat, says the report in the August issue of the journal Health Psychology. 
   
'Children in the most stressed category ate more fatty foods and more snacks, but they were also less likely to consume the recommended five or more fruits and vegetables or eat a daily breakfast,' says Jane Wardle, director of Cancer Research UK's Health Behaviour Unit.    Some prior researchers had found that  stress  was linked to eating more, while others connected it with eating less. 
   
This could be bad news down the road, the researchers note: Obesity heading into the teenage years increases the chances of being overweight as an adult, which can then lead to increased risk of  heart disease ,  cancer  or  Type 2 diabetes . 
   
Wardle's team asked the children to take a standard test for stress, with questions like, 'How often have you felt that you couldn't control the important things in your life?' 
   
They also inquired about the students' consumption of 34 fatty food items, and how many servings of fruit and vegetables they ate each day, how often they snacked, and how frequently they ate breakfast. (Eating a healthy breakfast has been shown to have a positive effect on long-term health.) 
   
Wardle found that the strongest association for stress was with fatty foods. The most stressed students ate nearly twice the amount of the least stressed group, she says. 
   
Curiously, overweight students said they were less likely to eat fatty foods, snacks and breakfast. Overweight children claiming to eat less may seem contradictory, but Wardle says that obese adults typically underreport their daily energy intake, too. 
   
Ethnic identity played a role in eating patterns, too. Asian students, who made up 8 percent of the sample, ate the best diets, and black students (comprising 19 percent) the worst, with white children (62 percent of the participants) in the middle. Higher socioeconomic status was also correlated with healthier eating practices. 
   
'Stress appears to be consistently harmful to children in terms of steering their food choices away from the healthy and towards the unhealthy,' she says. 
   
Wardle and her collaborators hope to follow this group of children, observing them as they grow older, to track their diets and their health.

Tumor characteristics may help predict survival in  breast cancer  patients, say researchers from Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center   

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (USA) - An 11-year study of breast cancer patients who had tumors removed but had no evidence of  cancer  in their lymph nodes has confirmed that certain factors may predict cancer recurrence - and help physicians decide who should get additional treatment .   
The research, from Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, is reported in the April issue of Clinical Cytometry.    'Despite years of research, it is still unclear which women with node-negative breast cancer will need  chemotherapy  and which women are cured by the surgery and do not need any additional chemotherapy,' said Timothy Kute, Ph.D., associate professor of pathology and cancer biology.    'Our study adds to the evidence that there are predictive factors that can help women avoid unnecessary treatment.' 
   
In one of the first studies to follow a large group of breast cancer patients after diagnosis, the researchers examined tumors of 556 patients diagnosed between 1991 and 1996.    They followed the patients until 2002 - to allow time to detect recurrence and cancer deaths - using information from area hospital cancer registries. The patients were followed for a median of 7.8 years. 
   
Kute and colleagues analyzed 12 different characteristics of the  tumor  tissue. The factor most predictive of an early recurrence rate was high S-phase fraction (SPF), or how rapidly cancer cells divide.    The factor most predictive of a later recurrence was diploid status, which refers to cells having normal amounts of DNA, or the carrier of genetic information. Patients whose tumors were diagnosed at an older age had later recurrences compared to younger patients. 
   
Predictors of an earlier death were: 
   

High SPF and larger tumor size 
   
A high concentration of cathepsin D, an enzyme that degrades tissue and allows for spread of disease 
   
Higher histologic grade, which is determined by a pathology examination. Tumors with a higher grade have cells that aren't normal-looking and tend to grow and spread more aggressively.
Previous research from other institutions also pointed to the importance of SPF; and a National Institutes of Health consensus conference proposed it as a potential marker. 
   
'This is one of the few studies to follow breast cancer patients knowing their prognostic factors,' said Gretchen Kimmick, M.D., an oncologist at Wake Forest Baptist. 'It confirms what we had suspected about predictors of recurrence and gives us an added level of confidence in making treatment recommendations.' 
   
A secondary - but surprising - finding of the research was that patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery did worse than patients who were not treated. Adjuvant chemotherapy is the use of drugs as additional treatment after surgery for patients with cancers that may have spread outside their original sites. 
   
In particular, 23 percent, or 37 out of 161 patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy had a recurrence of cancer within five years. For those patients who were not treated with chemotherapy, the recurrence rate was 9 percent, or 35 out of 395 patients.    

Twenty percent of the treated patients died within five years, compared to 7.6 percent of the non-treated patients. Previous research studies in patients whose breast cancer had not spread to the lymph nodes showed that adjuvant chemotherapy improves clinical outcomes.    

In those studies, there were two identical groups of patients - one group received adjuvant chemotherapy and one group didn't. Both groups had similar prognostic factors. In the current study, however, doctors recommended treatment based on patients' prognostic indicators. 
   
'Our explanation for these contradictory survival results is that physicians ordered adjuvant chemotherapy for those patients that they believed were at highest risk of recurrence based on their best knowledge about prognostic factors,' Kute said.    

'Interestingly, the patients who were treated had the predictive factors for early recurrence and death that were confirmed in our study. So it's not surprising that they did worse than patients without chemotherapy. Those same patients likely would have done worse anyway.' 
   
Kute said the researchers do not believe that cancer patients or their physicians should take the results to mean that chemotherapy is not useful in treatment of node-negative breast cancer. He said the results point to the need for more effective chemotherapy for that subset of patients with poor prognostic indicators.

Patients who have suffered a head injury may be more likely to develop  depression , say researchers.    
A small study published in a US journal revealed that head injury patients had a higher risk of problems than patients who had suffered other injuries. 
   
A third of those examined by doctors in Iowa City (USA) showed signs of depressive illness within a year. 
   
Patients who suffered major bouts of depression had differences in the physical structure of their brains. 
   
The mechanism by which a head injury might cause changes of mood and behaviour are poorly understood. 
   
However, many people who have suffered a head injury become more irritable and aggressive, or endure  anxiety  attacks or full-blown clinical depression. 
   
The Iowa study looked at 91 patients who had experienced a ' traumatic brain injury ', and 27 who had suffered other injuries - but not a head injury. 
   
They were checked every few months to see if they were suffering any kind of mental problems. 
   
High rates
   
Of the head injury patients, 33% were diagnosed with 'major depressive disorder' during the first year. 
   
Many of these also had symptoms of anxiety and 56% showed aggressive behaviour. 
   
Depression was significantly more likely among the head injury patients compared with those with other injuries. 
   
Looking at the records of more than 900 other patients with brain injury suggested that half of those with severe or moderate injuries suffered some kind of psychiatric illness in the first year. 
   
Among hundreds of patients with other injuries, only one in five were recorded as having psychiatric problems. 
   
Dr Huw Williams, from Exeter University, told BBC News Online that doctors were becoming increasingly aware of the mental problems faced by head injury patients even after the physical side of their injury had disappeared. 
   
He said: 'This backs up what other studies have been saying about depression and head injuries. There is a very high rate. 
   
'It reinforces the importance of good neuro-rehab after this kind of injury. Both the NHS and organisations such as Headway have a big role to play in helping people in this situation. 
   
'At the moment, neuro-rehab services are best described as patchy.' 
   
The research was published in the Archives of General Psychiatry. ",0

Scientists think they have found a gene combination which allows the deadly spread of  cancer  around the body.    
While the findings are currently restricted to fruit flies, the team from Yale University in the US say similar genes may exist in humans. 
   
Cancers that spread, or metastasise, are some of the hardest to treat. 
   
The research, published in the journal Science, suggests there might one day be a way of blocking the spread of cancer by targeting one of the genes involved. 
   
The reason why certain cancer cells are able to leave their original  tumour  and migrate to other sites around the body are still poorly understood. 
   
However, scientists know that finding ways to stop this happening could potentially save many lives from the disease. 
   
Many believe that metastasis has a genetic root - with mutant genes in the tumour cells somehow circumventing normal safeguards which stop them growing uncontrollably then 'breaking out' to take hold elsewhere. 
   
However, with the likelihood that a combination of genes, rather than just one, is responsible for this, finding the culprits within the vast human genome is like finding a needle in a haystack. 
   
Fly solution
   
Instead, the Yale scientists turned their attention to Drosophila melanogaster a simple fruit fly that has a far smaller genome. 
   
They say that despite their apparent obvious differences, fruit flies and humans share many of the same genes, so it could be possible to study tumour spread in flies - and apply those findings in man. 
   
Other teams have already revealed a gene called 'Ras v12' - present in both flies and humans - which, when mutated, is thought to play a significant role in helping the tumour flourish in some types of cancer. 
   
However, this alone does not seem to produce cancer spread. 
   
The US researchers launched a screening programme - creating flies which have the mutant Ras v12 genes, then interfering with other key genes to see if they could find the combination which led to metastasis. 
   
They found a number of genes which normally play a role in the normal running of the cell, which, if inactivated in a tumour cell, produced flies with cancers that spread copiously. 
   
Blocking the problem
   
The study is more evidence of the guilt of the Ras gene in metastatic cancer. 
   
The more that researchers understand about the possible genes involved in cancer spread, the more chance there is of a method being created to interrupt it. 
   
In this case, the researchers believe that there may be a clear chemical 'pathway' within the cell which could influence the behaviour of many of the genes which might partner Ras V12 and cause problems. 
   
This in theory means that a drug might be found that can activate this pathway. 
   
Dr Wen Jiang, from the Metastasis Research Group at the University of Wales College of Medicine, said that the research was 'an interesting piece of work'. 
   
'They have created a new model to investigate the genetic events during the non- invasive to invasive phase of a tumour. 
   
'So far, this has been extremely difficult to study in humans, due largely to the limitation of capturing the right moment and correct tumour. 
   
'It has provided some early information that metastatic events and growth events may be distinct at genetic level. 
   
'The scientific community yet has to fully understand the genetic basis of this switch between non-invasive and invasive.' ",0

Women with a high-fat diet may double their risk of developing  breast cancer  later in life, say researchers.    
A study of more than 13,000 women from Norfolk found that women who ate more than 90 grams of fat a day were twice as likely to develop  cancer , compared with those who ate 40 grams or less. 
   
Many large studies have failed to find a link between fat and breast cancer, but experts say that the type of food survey used by earlier researchers may have masked the problem. 
   
It is already known that being obese raises the risk of breast cancer, but this study points the finger at fatty foods in particular. 
   
Writing in The Lancet medical journal, experts from the Medical Research Council's Dunn Human Nutrition Unit in Cambridge reported details of detailed 'food diaries' taken from the women. 
   
Double chance 
   
Women in the top 20% bracket for consumption of saturated fats were roughly twice as likely as women in the lowest 20% bracket to develop breast cancer. 
   
The women had been carefully matched so that other factors which might skew the results, such as other unhealthy lifestyles, were taken into account. 
   
Dr Sheila Bingham, the unit's deputy director, said: 'The study shows there is an emerging link between eating too much fatty food and increasing the risk of breast cancer. 
   
'The effect seems to be related particularly to saturated fat found mostly in high fat milk, butter, meat and some cereals such as biscuits and cakes.' 
   
Sensible eating 
   
Dr Lesley Walker, from Cancer Research UK, said: 'Study the link between diet and cancer is a complex business. 
   
'The study continues to uncover more information about how the two can be connected. 
   
'This research highlights the importance of eating sensibly to reduce cancer risk.' 
   
The incidence of breast cancer in developed countries is increasing steadily - it is now the most common cancer in women in the UK. 
   
Many more cases are now detected early because of breast screening programmes, and improvements in drug treatments are boosting cure rates. 
   
Delyth Morgan, Chief Executive of Breakthrough Breast Cancer said: 'Breast cancer is an extremely complex disease and it's difficult to research the impact of specific dietary factors, such as fat intake alone, on breast cancer risk. 
   
'Breakthrough would welcome any improvements in research methods which help establish with certainty, breast cancer risk factors.' ",0

A study in the May Journal of the American Geriatrics Society combats the notion that ethnic differences and inherent 

biases are responsible for a lower number of  depression  diagnoses in the African American elderly population versus whites. 

   
Researchers from Michigan surveyed nearly 180 primary care providers, randomly assigning them to view one of four videos 

exhibiting commonly accepted traits of a depressed older adult. The actors used in the videos worked from the same script and 

differed only by race and/or sex. Eighty-five percent of providers correctly diagnosed the \""patient\"" on the video they were 

assigned.    
\""Primary care providers are just as likely to diagnose and treat depression in older African Americans as in whites, 

suggesting that bias based simply on apparent patient race is not a likely explanation for the lower rates of depression 

diagnosis and treatment in older African Americans,\"" according to researchers.    
The study notes that the management of depression is especially critical in the elderly due to already existing and multiple 

illnesses. Further, studies show that older adults are less likely to seek specific  mental health  treatment from 

psychiatrists, turning solely to their primary care physicians.

Fox Chase Cancer Center research shows  kidney cancer  can be diagnosed in urine   

PHILADELPHIA (USA) ? Laboratory researchers and urologic oncologists from Fox Chase Cancer Center have demonstrated the ability to identify kidney cancer, including localized (stage I)  cancer , in the urine of affected patients.    

The research, supported in part by a grant from the Flight Attendants Medical Research Institute and the National Cancer Institute's Early Detection Research Network, is published in the Dec. 15 issue of the journal Cancer Research.    
As with other cancers, an early diagnosis of kidney cancer can result in curative treatment whereas the prognosis for advanced kidney cancer is poor. The challenge in diagnosing cancer early is developing an inexpensive, noninvasive, accurate and simple screening test. 
   
The researchers say a urine test meets these standards. Currently, kidney cancer is diagnosed after radiographic imaging of the kidney, which may include an  ultrasound ,  CT scan  and/or  MRI .    Biopsy of a kidney mass is often difficult to interpret or may give a false negative result and therefore currently confirmation of radiographic results is primarily after surgical excision. There is no protein marker test for kidney cancer as there is for  prostate cancer  with the PSA test. 
   
'We used a common laboratory procedure to test the urine of 50 patients with kidney cancer,' explained Fox Chase molecular biologist Paul Cairns, Ph.D., lead author of the study.    'Forty-four of the 50 tests showed gene changes in the urine that were identical to the gene changes found in the  tumor  samples taken at the time of surgery.' 
   
When the same test was conducted on the controls ? urine from people without cancer ? none showed the relevant gene alterations that were found in the urine from people with cancer. 
   
'The test is remarkably accurate with no false-positives in this study,' said Robert G. Uzzo, M.D., a urologic surgeon at Fox Chase and co-author of the paper.    'In addition, one of the most impressive outcomes of this research is that the test also identified 27 of the 30 patients with stage I disease. Finding these cancers early means earlier treatment and better prognosis.'
   
The researchers used a molecular DNA-based test called methylation-specific PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to detect genetic alterations that initiate and fuel the onset of cancer.    The test searched for six cancer specific tumor-suppressor genes that were altered ? causing them to falter in their critical role of preventing errant cell growth. These six genes are usually identified only after a pathologist's review of tumor tissue. 
   
'If these results are confirmed in larger studies, this urine-based test may play a vital role in kidney cancer diagnosis,' said Cairns.

Young women who eat more red meat and full-fat dairy products such as cheese may be raising their risk of  breast cancer , researchers reported on Tuesday. 
   
They said their study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, provides yet another incentive for women to shun fatty foods and consume fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains. 
   
'When we compared the women in the highest fat intake group with women in lowest intake group, those with the highest intake had a 33 percent greater risk of invasive breast cancer,' Eunyoung Cho of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School said in a telephone interview. 
   
Cho said her study was unique because it included women who had not reached  menopause . Breast cancer takes years to develop, although it usually shows up after menopause, and factors early in a woman's life may be important. 
   
Women most at risk of breast cancer obtained, on average, 23 percent of  calories  from animal fat, versus 12 percent in the lowest-risk group. 
   
Vegetable fats such as olive oil did not affect a woman's risk. 'We found that it was not total fat but certain types of fat that was related to breast cancer risk,' Cho said. 
   
The study of more than 90,000 women aged 26 to 46 was taken from the Nurses' Health Study, in which volunteers answer regular questionnaires about diet and lifestyle and that data is analyzed by researchers who track the women's health. 
   
Over the eight years of the study, 714 women developed invasive breast cancer. 
   
'Overall, we observed that there was a higher risk of breast cancer among women who ate foods rich in animal fat such as red meat, cheese, ice cream and butter during their 20s, 30s and 40s,' Cho said. 
   
Controversial area   
'In an area of breast cancer research that has yielded often starkly different findings, we have illustrated that there may be stronger support for lowering overall animal fat intake, especially during a woman's early adult life,' she added. 
   
Hydrogenated oils, hardened to be more like butter and lard, clog arteries just like butter and lard do. Last week the U.S. government said it would require food manufacturers to label foods with trans-fats -- found in animal and hydrogenated fat. 
   
Researchers have long noted that the rates of certain  cancers  are higher in the West than in Asia. But it has not been clear whether that is due to what people eat -- such as animal fat and dairy products -- or what they do not eat -- perhaps soy, vegetables or other products. 
   
Cho, an epidemiologist who studies patterns of disease as well as a nutritionist, said it is not clear how animal fat may cause cancer. 
   
'Fat intake in general has been hypothesized to increase circulating hormone levels such  estrogen  levels,' she said. 
   
Cooked red meat contains cancer-causing agents and is also liked with  colon cancer . 
   
Eating less meat and full-fat dairy can also help a woman reduce her risk of  heart disease , the No. 1 killer of both men and women in the industrialized world, Cho said. 
   
According to the World Health Organization, more than 1.2 million people will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year. Breast cancer will kill more than 40,000 Americans this year. ",0

Job insecurity is associated with a moderate increased risk of diabetes, according to a large study of workers in Australia, the United States and several countries in Europe published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal).

""In common parlance, job insecurity is understood to refer to employed workers who feel threatened by unemployment,"" states lead author Dr. Jane Ferrie, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom.

To understand whether there is a link between job insecurity and the risk of diabetes, a team of researchers looked at data from open-access studies and cohort studies participating in the European-based Individual-Participant-Data Meta-analysis in Working Populations Consortium (IPD Work Consortium) research program. The 19 studies included 140 825 participants with a mean age of 42.2 years, of whom 81 816 were women and 59 009 were men. After adjusting for age, sex and other factors, the researchers found a 19% increase in the number of new cases of diabetes in workers with job insecurity.

""These results are consistent with other studies, showing that job insecurity is associated with weight gain, a risk factor for diabetes, and, with incident coronary heart disease, a complication of diabetes,"" Ferrie states.

The authors found no previous studies linking job insecurity with new cases of diabetes.

""These findings are most appropriately interpreted in a public health context in which small long-term effects on common disease outcomes can have high relevance,"" write the authors. ""Ideally in such situations, policy responses should take a population-level approach to reducing exposure to job insecurity. Also, health care personnel should be aware that workers reporting job insecurity may be a modest increased risk of diabetes.""

Minor  depression , an underdiagnosed and undertreated subset of major depressive disorder that affects upwards of 15 million Americans*, can be effectively treated with a drug called a selective  serotonin  reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), according to a multi-center study led by the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and published in the October 2004 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry.   

?This is especially important since patients with minor depression are not only at risk for significant psychosocial impairment, but for major depressive episodes that can be even more debilitating,? said the study's lead author, Lewis L. Judd, M.D., professor of psychiatry and chair of the UCSD Department of Psychiatry   

He added that unclear categories of illness and diagnosis in the past have led psychiatrists to generally consider minor depression to be a negligible condition that didn't require any treatment. While some  mental health  professionals have considered minor depression to be a non-specific variation of normal mood, more recent studies have identified it as a clinically significant medical condition.**   

Now, urging that minor depression can and should be treated, Judd said the new study of 162 patients with minor depressive disorder showed that patients given the SSRI fluoxetine (brand name Prozac) over a 12-week period showed significantly greater improvement in mood and psychosocial function as compared to depressed patients receiving a  placebo . Several standard psychiatric tests were used to compare the results.***   

The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) notes that minor depression is a common disorder that can impair a person's functioning and quality of life, and serve as a serious risk factor for major depression. The difference between major and minor depression is the number of symptoms. Major depressive disorder includes the primary criteria of sadness plus at least five symptoms (such as  insomnia , weight loss or gain, low energy, difficulty concentrating, reduction in sexual drive, suicidal ideas and/or behavior, psychomotor slowing, restlessness or irritability, inertia to initiate activity, and persistent physical symptoms, such as  headache  or digestive disorders, that don't respond to treatment); minor depression includes the same primary sadness plus one or two additional symptoms.
   
Judd, a former director of the NIMH and a national expert on depression, said ?minor depression is the same as or a less severe variant of major depressive disorder. Significantly, it doesn't reach the threshold of a major depression. In previous studies, we've seen that depressive symptoms wax and wane over an individual's lifetime, with most depressed patients usually suffering from minor depression more of the time than major depression.?   

Because it impairs individuals, Judd and the other leaders of the study recommend treatment for minor depression, especially before it balloons into a major episode. His co-leaders and co-authors of the study were A. John Rush, M.D., University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas; and David J. Kupfer, M.D., University of Pittsburgh.   

The UCSD study coordinator and co-author of the paper was Mark H. Rapaport, M.D., then a member of the UCSD Department of Psychiatry and currently chair of the Department of Psychiatry at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California. Rapaport noted that the study ?is one of the first and largest studies to evaluate the efficacy of an SSRI in the treatment of a well characterized cohort of subjects with minor depression. It has shown us that treating less than major depression with an SSRI does work.?   

Additional authors of the study were Kimberly A. Yonkers, M.D., Yale University School of Medicine; Ellen Frank, Ph.D. and Michael E. Thase, M.D., University of Pittsburgh; John M. Plewes, M.D., Pamela J. Schettler, Ph.D., and Gary Tollefson, M.D., Ph.D., Eli Lilly & Co. 
   
The study was funded by an unrestricted investigator-initiated contract from Eli Lilly & Co. and by grants from the NIMH and the Roher Fund of the University of California, San Diego.

The NIMH definition of depression: A depressive disorder is an illness that involves the body, mood, and thoughts. It affects the way a person eats and sleeps, the way one feels about oneself, and the way one thinks about things. A depressive disorder is not the same as a passing blue mood. It is not a sign of personal weakness or a condition that can be willed or wished away. People with a depressive illness cannot merely ""pull themselves together"" and get better. Without treatment, symptoms can last for weeks, months, or years. Appropriate treatment, however, can help most people who suffer from depression.

A just published UCLA study suggests that the use of  antidepressants  to treat  depression  has saved thousands of lives, despite the concern about a possible link between suicide risk and the class of drugs called selective  serotonin  reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). 
The lead author of the study is Dr. Julio Licinio, the new chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Miami Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine. Licinio conducted the study at UCLA while he was the director of the Center for Pharmacogenomics and Clinical Pharmacology at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior. 

  
Published in the June 2006 edition of the peer-reviewed journal PLoS Medicine, the study analyzes federal data on overall suicide rates since the early 1960s and sales of the SSRI fluoxetine, or Prozac, in the United States since the antidepressant's introduction in 1988 through 2002. 
   
The data show the U.S. suicide rate held fairly steady for 15 years prior to the introduction of fluoxetine, then dropped steadily over 14 years as sales of the antidepressant rose. The research team found the strongest effect among women. 
   
Mathematical modeling of probable suicide rates from 1988 to 2002, based on pre-1988 data, suggests a cumulative decrease in expected suicide mortality of 33,600 people since the introduction of the antidepressant. 
   
""Our findings certainly suggest that the introduction of SSRIs has contributed to reduction of suicide rates in the United States,"" Licinio said. ""However, the findings do not preclude the possibility of increased risk of suicide among small populations of individuals."" 
   
The Food and Drug Administration introduced ""black box warnings"" on the most popular SSRIs in 2004 amid rising concerns in the United States and United Kingdom concerning the relationship between suicide and antidepressant use in children and adults. 
   
A key unanswered question involves whether antidepressants increase suicide over and above the underlying disorder, such as major depression. 
   
""Much of the psychiatric community fears that the absence of treatment may prove more harmful to depressed individuals than the effects of the drugs themselves,"" Licinio said. ""Most people who commit suicide suffer from untreated depression. Our goal is to explore a possible SSRI suicide link while ensuring that effective treatment and drug development for depression is not halted without cause."" 
   
The study examined age-adjusted suicide rate data from the Centers for Disease Control and the U.S. Census Bureau from the early 1960s until 2002. Data show suicide rates fluctuated between 12.2 and 13.7 per 100,000 people for the entire U.S. population until 1988. Since then, suicide rates have gradually declined, with the lowest rate at 10.4 per 100,000 in 2000. The decline is significantly associated with increased numbers of fluoxetine prescriptions dispensed, from 2.47 million in 1988 to 33.32 million in 2002. 
   
Major depressive disorder affects approximately 10 percent of American men and 20 percent of women over their lifetimes. Because the prevalence is so high and treatment lasts several months or years, antidepressant medications are the most common form of treatment. Fluoxetine is the most widely prescribed antidepressant medication in the world and the only antidepressant that is FDA-approved for treatment of depression in children.

People with diabetes are one step closer to more easily checking their blood glucose levels with a non-invasive device for detecting and monitoring blood glucose levels, which is currently in development. The hand-held breathalyzer device detects acetone, which has been linked to high blood glucose levels in the breath. The research is being presented at the 2016 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS) Annual Meeting and Exposition, the world's largest pharmaceutical sciences meeting. The meeting is taking place in Denver Nov. 13-17.

Although testing technology has improved in recent decades, with the finger stick testing, as many as 67 percent of people with diabetes may not comply because it is invasive and somewhat painful. Yet, lack of blood-glucose monitoring can result in serious diabetes-related complications. For example, if a person's blood glucose is too low, complications can include seizures, loss of consciousness, and even death. If a person's blood glucose is too high, complications can include infections, cardiovascular disease and nerve and kidney damage.

""We believe this technology will be a great improvement in the lives of people with diabetes,"" said Priefer. ""It is the first non-invasive medical device for detecting and monitoring diabetes by connecting one's acetone levels with their blood glucose. We believe it is a necessary alternative to the finger-prick approach for people living with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.""

Ronny Priefer, Ph.D. and his colleague, Michael Rust, Ph.D., both out of Western New England University in Springfield, Mass., have developed a device - currently the size of small book - that individuals blow into to check their blood glucose levels.

Priefer and his team tested the device in a blind study of 50 people: 26 did not have diabetes, 16 had type 2 diabetes, and 8 people had type 1 diabetes. Using the device in conjunction with the sensor slides, when patients blow into the device, readings are immediately taken. The acetone level is instantly correlated to a blood glucose level, which allows patients to determine how much insulin they need to take when their glucose levels are high. Stage 1 clinical results found clear correlations between blood glucose levels and breath acetone. The only outlier found was in a small number of smokers, whom had higher levels of acetone in the breath due to the combustion of tobacco.

Priefer's goal is to have a device by the end of 2017 that patients can bring home and track their blood glucose levels over time. He is also working to make the device even smaller.

DURHAM, N.C. (USA) -- Women with  breast cancer  have fewer adverse effects from  chemotherapy  and less  fatigue  when using virtual reality as a distraction intervention during treatments, according to a study from the Duke University School of Nursing and Case Western Reserve Comprehensive Cancer Center. 
   
In the study, published in the January 2004 issue of Oncology Nursing Forum, the researchers described how chemotherapy patients eased their fatigue and discomfort by solving a mystery, touring an art gallery or going deep-sea diving in a virtual environment as they underwent treatment. 
   
Virtual reality enables people to immerse themselves in a computer-generated visual and aural environment by wearing a head-mounted display device.   

The researchers believe that virtual reality makes for an excellent distraction intervention because it is interactive, engages several senses simultaneously and immerses participants in a new world, thereby blocking out their current and often stressful environment. 
   
That stressful environment was almost too much for chemotherapy patient Donna Honeycutt of Elon, N.C. She worried that she wouldn't be able to complete the entire series of treatments she needed to have the best chance of beating her breast cancer. 
   
'You're in a room with many other people receiving chemotherapy. Some are very sick and you tend to always look at the individual who's sickest. For me, I felt sicker when I was in this environment,' said Honeycutt, who underwent her chemotherapy two years ago and completed a portion of her treatments using virtual reality. 
   
Susan Schneider, Ph.D., director of the oncology program at Duke University School of Nursing and lead author on the paper, said that helping patients keep their minds off the stresses of chemotherapy can be both physically and mentally important to patients. 
   
'I've been a nurse for more than 20 years, and I've noticed if patients can focus on something other than their treatments, they have less nausea and vomiting and they tolerate the treatments better,' said Schneider.    'For some that distraction intervention might be knitting or reading a book, but our study examined the effectiveness virtual reality, specifically in breast cancer patients.' 
   
Schneider and researchers at Case Western Reserve enrolled 20 breast cancer patients, between the ages of 18 and 55, who were scheduled to receive chemotherapy.    Participants alternatively received chemotherapy treatments with the help of virtual reality and without.  

While using virtual reality, patients could choose between a variety of commercially available programs, such as walking on a beach, touring an art gallery or deep-sea diving. 
   
'We carefully reviewed these programs. They had to be G-rated and interactive, but not overstimulating,' said Schneider. 'Fast movements can cause nausea or dizziness, and scenarios requiring too much focus on details can be overly demanding for patients receiving chemotherapy.' 
   
The goal of the intervention was to ease  anxiety , fatigue and symptom distress. Symptom distress encompasses the discomfort the patients experienced from receiving chemotherapy.    Such symptoms include nausea and vomiting, inability to concentrate, and fatigue. According to the researchers, such distress interferes with a person's ability to perform activities of daily living and affects quality of life.    Nearly 60 percent of chemotherapy patients report some form of symptom distress. 
   
After each treatment, the women were asked to complete surveys about their symptom distress, anxiety level and fatigue level. After treatments using the virtual reality, the participants answered open-ended surveys about their thoughts and opinions on the technology. 
   
The results of trial showed women who used virtual reality during chemotherapy treatments reported significant decreases in symptom distress and fatigue immediately following treatments. Anxiety levels were not directly impacted by the intervention, found the researchers. 
   
'Our data show a drop in anxiety levels directly after the treatment, but we attributed this to the patient's relief about the treatment being over,' said Schneider.    'However, one added benefit was that the virtual reality seemed to make patients feel as though time was moving faster. For example, on average, a chemotherapy treatment might last 67 minutes, but patients would perceive that it only lasted 42 minutes.' 
   
All the study participants preferred chemotherapy treatments with virtual reality than using no intervention, and 95 percent of said they would be willing to use it again.    No participants reported 'cyber sickness,' which is dizziness, queasiness or visual disturbances resulting from use of virtual reality. No patients reported  headaches  due to the eight-ounce headsets or from using the technology. 
   
Honneycutt, who participated in a similar trial of Schneider's at Duke University Medical Center, said she benefited greatly from using virtual reality. 
   
'I just did not get sick,' she said. 'I did not get nauseated. I didn't get violently ill like most people. And I think it's because you separate yourself from that initially. The virtual reality helps take you away from it all.' 
   
Schneider's results confirm other studies she has conducted in pediatric  cancer  patients and women over 55 with breast cancer. Currently she is conducting a larger trial of 120 patients to study how the virtual reality intervention works for patients with colon, lung and breast cancer. 

The goal of the study, open to men and women over the age of 21, will determine if age, diagnosis or coping style influence how well the virtual reality works during chemotherapy treatments. Schneider is encouraged by the results and said that virtual reality is a cost-effective intervention that works in a real world setting. 
   
'The headsets and programs are cost-effective and easy to use for both patients and providers. The equipment can be set up in five minutes and several patients can use a single set of equipment throughout the day,' she said. 'A clinic can purchase a headset, computer and software for about $1,800, and the cost of using virtual reality for a single treatment is about $5.' 
   
Schneider said larger studies are needed to further understand for whom virtual reality works best, how virtual reality compares to other distraction interventions and how to achieve lasting reductions in symptom distress and fatigue for patients after they have left the clinical setting. 
   
The study was funded by the Comprehensive Cancer Center at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals of Cleveland, as well as an American Cancer Society Institutional research grant.    

Co-authors include Maryjo Price-Paul of Hospice of the Western Reserve and Lorain County Community College; Paula Silverman, M.D., Case Western Reserve University Comprehensive Cancer Center at University Hospitals Health System; and Deborah Talaba, Centers for Dialysis Care in Cleveland.

The risk of serious suicide attempts or death by suicide generally decreases in the weeks after patients start taking  antidepressant  medication, according to a new study led by Group Health Cooperative researchers and published in the January issue of The American Journal of Psychiatry. The study also found that the risk of suicidal behavior after starting 10 newer antidepressant medications is less than the risk posed by older medications.    

These findings challenge a 2004 advisory by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which warned that suicidal behavior may emerge after treatment with the newer antidepressant drugs has begun.    

\""Our findings show that, fortunately, suicide attempts and death by suicide are rare following the initiation of antidepressants,\"" says Greg Simon, MD, MPH, a Group Health psychiatrist and the lead researcher on the study. \""The period right after people start taking antidepressant medication is not a period of increased risk. In fact, risk after starting medication is lower than before.\""    

This study is the first published analysis to compare the risk of suicide attempts before treatment to the risks following treatment. It is based on computerized medical and pharmacy records for more than 65,000 patients who filled prescriptions for antidepressants from 1992 to 2003. Deaths by suicide were determined from death certificates and suicide attempts were identified from hospital discharge data.    

Group Health researchers found that the number of suicide attempts fell by 60 percent in adults during the month after antidepressant treatment began, and declined further in the following five months. Among the 65,103 patients taking antidepressants, there were 31 completed suicides in the six months following the antidepressant prescription. That rate was not higher in the one month after the prescription than in subsequent months. The study also found that newer antidepressants were associated with a faster decline in rates of suicidal behavior than older drugs.    

Adolescents in the study had more suicide attempts than adults. The researchers found that the rate for the first six months of antidepressant treatment was 314 attempts per 100,000 in teens and 78 attempts per 100,000 in adults. As with adults, the rate was highest in the month before treatment and declined by about 60 percent after treatment began.    

Given recent public concern over a possible link between suicide and antidepressants, Simon says he fears people may mistakenly believe that suicidal behavior is common after taking antidepressant medications. That misperception could lead to fewer people with  depression  being treated with medications proven to be effective in battling depression, he adds.    

\""There may be subgroups of people who become more agitated or suicidal after taking these drugs, and those people should seek help from a doctor or therapist right away if that happens,\"" says Simon. \""But our study showed that on average, the risk of suicide actually goes down after people start taking the antidepressant.\""    

Simon agrees with the FDA\'s recommendations that doctors carefully monitor people taking antidepressants. \""Keeping a close watch on patients after they begin taking these drugs is a good idea--although not because these medicines are especially risky or dangerous,\"" he says. \""Patients need to be monitored to ensure they\'re getting the right medication in the amount that can help them feel better.\""    

The National Institute of Mental Health funded Simon\'s study. Other researchers on the study were James Savarino, PhD, and Belinda Operskalski, MPH, of Group Health\'s Center for Health Studies, and Philip S. Wang, MD, of Harvard Medical School\'s Department of Health Care Policy.

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by impaired glucose metabolism and can cause central nervous system-related complications, such as memory dysfunction. The hippocampus is an essential brain component for normal memory formation. However, the effect of impaired glycometabolism on hippocampal-mediated memory in type 2 diabetes patients is not known.

In a new study, researchers centered at the University of Tsukaba investigated whether hippocampal glucose metabolism and memory function is altered in a rat model of type 2 diabetes. Based on the idea that exercise normalizes glycometabolism and improves memory function, the research team also investigated the effects of exercise on hippocampal glycometabolism and memory formation.

Hippocampal function was evaluated by placing the rat in a circular pool and testing its ability to remember the location of a platform that would allow it to escape from the water. ""This is a well-established method for measuring spatial learning and memory,"" study first author Takeru Shima says.

Type 2 diabetic rats needed more time to escape the water and find the platform. However, after 4 weeks of moderate exercise, they were able to find the platform much faster. ""This indicated that exercise significantly improved spatial memory impairments in type 2 diabetic rats,"" Shima explains.

Glycogen levels are altered in tissues of diabetes patients, leading to a variety of complications. However, glycogen levels have not yet been investigated in the hippocampus. ""We showed for the first time that glycogen levels are significantly higher in the hippocampus of diabetic rats,"" corresponding author Hideaki Soya says.

Interestingly, single bout of exercise reduced hippocampal glycogen levels and this correlated with an increase in lactate levels. Lactate is an energy substrate and neuromodulator in the hippocampus, and is known to enhance memory formation. Lactate is transferred to neurons through monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). ""MCT2 expression was significantly lower in the hippocampus of type 2 diabetic rats,"" Soya says, ""dysregulated MCT2-mediated neuronal uptake of lactate is a possible aetiology of memory dysfunction in type 2 diabetes, and that elevated hippocampal glycogen may be an adaptive change to compensate for the decreased lactate utilization"".

4 weeks of moderate exercise further enhanced glycogen levels and normalized MCT2 expression in the hippocampus of type 2 diabetic rats."" These findings suggest that disrupted MCT2-mediated uptake of lactate by neurons contributes to memory dysfunction in type 2 diabetic rats.

The findings indicate that moderate exercise could be used to treat memory impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes by promoting the transfer of glycogen-derived lactate to hippocampal neurons.

The number of children born to single women is increasing, partly as a result of social and legislative changes (in most jurisdictions) in the rights to parenthood. While technology has been readily able to meet this rising demand through donor insemination and even IVF, little is known about how children think, feel and fare growing up in the families formed by single women.

A study performed at the Centre for Family Research at the University of Cambridge, UK, and presented as a poster in Helsinki at the Annual Meeting of ESHRE suggests that the children are generally well adjusted, with positive feelings about family life, although they do raise questions about the absence of a father in their families. ""Indeed,"" said researcher Dr Sophie Zadeh, ""at the age at which children begin to understand their family circumstances, they continue to function well.""

The study was an evaluation of 51 solo mother families who were compared (both quantitatively and qualitatively) with 52 heterosexual two-parent families with at least one donor-conceived child aged 4-9 years. The participating families were matched in terms of the age and gender of the target child, and on demographic factors including the mother's educational level. The study, said Dr Zadeh, is the first to examine child adjustment and children's perspectives in solo mother families at an age at which children are old enough to understand their family circumstances and what it means to grow up without a father - and the only study to assess children's own reports about their social and family experiences.

Mothers in both groups answered standardised questionnaires of child adjustment and parenting stress. In addition, the solo mothers completed an interview which asked about their children's feelings about a father, and whether or not this was a topic of family discussion. A total of 47 children within these solo mother families agreed to be interviewed. They were asked about family life and friendships.

There was no significant difference between the two family types when assessed for child adjustment according to a standardised questionnaire. However, higher levels of financial difficulties within the solo mother families, and higher levels of parenting stress, were each associated with higher levels of child adjustment problems. Moreover, mothers mostly reported that their children had neutral (39%) or mixed (28%) feelings about the absence of a father, although qualitative analysis of mothers' reports showed that conversations about fathers were a prominent feature of family life.

As for the children themselves, most (89%) who answered a question about changing their family circumstances either expressed a desire for just trivial changes (38%) or no change (51%). Children mostly (59%) reported high (19%) or very high (40%) levels of enjoyment of school. All reported having at least one friend, and most (51%) named five or more friends. The majority (63%) had not been teased at school, or had experienced only trivial teasing (34%).

""Between the ages of 4 and 9, donor-conceived children in solo mother families generally seem to be doing well,"" said Dr Zadeh. ""However, we don't yet know how these children will fare over time, or what they will think and feel about being donor-conceived and/or growing up without a father in the home as they grow older.

""In general, our findings seem to suggest that what matters most for children's outcomes in solo mother families is not the absence of a father, nor donor conception, but the quality of parenting, and positive parent-child relationships. These findings therefore echo much of what we already know about the determinants of children's psychological adjustment in other family types.""

Cognitive therapy to treat moderate to severe  depression  works just as well as  antidepressants , according to an 

authoritative report appearing today in the Archives of General Psychiatry. The study, conducted by researchers at the 

University of Pennsylvania and Vanderbilt University, challenges the American Psychiatric Association's guidelines that 

antidepressant medications are the only effective treatment for moderately to severely depressed patients.    
Either form of treatment worked significantly better than a  placebo , but the researchers demonstrated that cognitive therapy 

was more effective than medication at preventing relapses after the end of treatment.    
""We believe that cognitive therapy might have more lasting effects because it equips patients with the tools they need to 

learn how to manage their problems and emotions,"" said Robert DeRubeis, professor and chair of Penn's Department of 

Psychology. ""Pharmaceuticals, while effective, offer no long term cure for the symptoms of depression. For many people, 

cognitive therapy might prove to be the preferred form of treatment.""    
The study, which follows years of debate on the relative merits of cognitive therapy versus medication for more severe forms 

of depression, is the largest trial yet undertaken on the topic; it involved 240 depressed patients. The patients were 

randomly placed into groups that received cognitive therapy, antidepressant medication or a placebo. Patients in the 

antidepressant group, which was twice as large as the other two, were treated with paroxetine (Paxil). Lithium or desipramine 

was also given, as necessary.    
After 16 weeks of treatment, patients in both the medication and cognitive therapy groups showed improvement at about the 

same rate; however, cognitive therapy patients were less likely to relapse in the two years following the end of treatment. 

According to the researchers, the return of symptoms might demonstrate that the medication may have blunted the appearance of 

depression but did not affect underlying disease processes.    
""Medication is often an appropriate treatment, but drugs have drawbacks, such as side effects or a diminished efficacy over 

time,"" DeRubeis said. ""Patients with depression are often overwhelmed by other factors in their life that pills simply cannot 

solve. In many cases, cognitive therapy succeeds because it teaches the skills that help people cope.""    
The researchers also noted slight differences in the response to treatment between the two testing locations, with cognitive 

therapy performing better at Penn and medications performing better at Vanderbilt. Researchers surmise that the medication 

worked so well at the Vanderbilt clinic because more of the patients there were markedly anxious, in addition to being 

depressed, and the medications used in the research have anti-anxiety properties.    
The researchers further believe that cognitive therapy patients might have done better at Penn due to the experience level of 

the therapists involved. Just as the experience of therapists may be important in cognitive therapy, so, too, can the 

expertise of prescribing physicians play a role in the success of antidepressant medication treatment. Studies have shown 

that antidepressant medication dosages are still largely a matter of physicians' discretion.    
""Clearly, cognitive therapy is not for everyone, and its success could depend on variables such as the expertise of the 

therapist and the patient's willingness or ability to take the therapy to heart,"" DeRubeis said. ""The key to establishing any 

form of treatment is rating its effectiveness in comparison to treatments currently in use, and this study has shown 

cognitive therapy to be a viable alternative.""    
Clinical researchers at the Penn School of Medicine's Department of Psychiatry involved in the study were Jay D. Amsterdam, 

Paula R. Young, John P. O'Reardon and Madeline M. Gladis. Vanderbilt researchers include Steven D. Hollon of the Department 

of Psychology and Richard C. Shelton, Ronald M. Salomon, Margaret L. Lovett, and Laurel L. Brown of the Department of 

Psychiatry. Contributing author Robert Gallop is with West Chester University's Department of Mathematics and Applied

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (USA) ? The way a doctor explains clinical trial options can affect a  cancer  patient's decision on whether to participate, says a Purdue University communication professor.
   
Felicia Roberts, a conversation analyst, studied how physicians communicated treatment options to patients considering  breast cancer  clinical trials, which are studies that evaluate a new therapy in fighting the disease. About 20,000 patients participate in clinical trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, according to the institute.
   
'This research shows that physicians have extremely different approaches to explaining and recommending clinical trials, and these varying differences may affect clinical trial enrollment,' said Roberts, whose research area is health communication.    'My work can serve as a mirror for doctors so they can see their communication patterns, which they are often not aware of. Sometimes just raising awareness can improve doctor-patient interactions.
   
'As more patients take a leading role in their own health care, it is important for cancer patients to understand that their perception of a doctor's medical recommendation can be influenced by the physician's communication style,' said Roberts, who authored 'Talking About Treatment: Recommendations for Breast Cancer Adjuvant Therapy.'
   
Her paper, 'Qualitative Differences Among Cancer Clinical Trial Explanations,' appeared in the December issue of Social Science & Medicine.
   
Roberts said doctors' presentation, structuring and delivery of clinical trial recommendations, as well as how they are perceived by patients, are comparatively new areas of study in health communication. 
   
'Despite fairly extensive surveys, retrospective studies and forensic study of medical records, there has been no detailed linguistic examination of the way physicians actually present clinical trials to patients,' Roberts said.    'I wanted to know what transpires in physician offices during explanations of the cancer clinical trial treatment option. This is one way to better understand factors affecting enrollments.'
   
Roberts' study examined how patients are recruited for trials and to what extent the physician encourages enrollment. Roberts studied 21 audio recordings of doctor-patient consultations, which were collected as part of another researcher's study concerning breast cancer treatment decisions. She selected two contrasting cases to document extreme differences in the doctors' approaches.
   
'Doctors walk a fine line when they speak to patients because they can't promise results even though, in my data, they tend to encourage treatment,' Roberts said.
   
One doctor identified the clinical trial as an 'institutional endeavor' and the other said the clinical trial is about 'finding the best treatments.' She also chronicled their word choices and the information they shared.
   
'Patients will likely never know all of the factors contributing to a physician's recommendation for a particular trial, or the oncologists' stance toward trials in general. All they have in front of them is how the option is presented,' Roberts said. 'Understanding the way alternatives are presented by doctors is central to improving patient-provider interaction.'

This paper examines how medical oncologists present to breast cancer patients the option of participating in experimental treatment trials. The investigation takes a case study approach, comparing two contrasting presentations of the clinical trial option.    

One presentation constructs the experimental trial as a locally organized, joint physician?patient effort to determine 'best' treatments, and minimizes uncertainty by oversimplification of the randomization process; the second presentation situates the clinical trial within the larger national research effort, underscores the uncertainty created by randomization and casts non-enrollment as a reasonable option.    

These observations provide initial evidence that physician presentation of the clinical trial varies substantially and provides the first detailed look at actual discourse practices used in the United States to recruit patients to experimental protocols. ",2

The researchers found that mice fed a high-calorie diet developed more brown fat, burned more calories, had less total body fat, and experienced less weight gain when treated with bexarotene (Bex) - a drug approved for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma - than rodents that did not receive the anticancer drug.

Senior researcher Sheng Ding, Ph.D., of the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco, CA, and colleagues recently published their findings in the journal Cell Reports.

Brown fat, or brown adipose tissue, is one of the two main types of fat in the human body, with the other being white fat. White fat is responsible for storing energy and heat insulation, whereas brown fat is responsible for burning energy through heat production, or thermogenesis. 

In babies, brown fat makes up around 5 percent of their total body mass and helps to keep them warm. As we age, however, the amount of brown fat we possess is reduced.

In recent years, studies have suggested that adults who have greater amounts of brown fat are leaner, and that increasing the production of brown fat may be an effective weight loss strategy.

""Introducing brown fat is an exciting new approach to treating obesity and associated metabolic diseases, such as diabetes,"" notes first study author Baoming Nie, Ph.D., a former postdoctoral scholar at Gladstone.

""All current weight loss drugs control appetite, and there is nothing on the market that targets energy expenditure,"" he adds. ""If we can create additional stores of brown fat and boost its function in the body, we could burn off the energy stored in white fat more easily.""

In order to increase brown fat stores, researchers have been searching for ways to turn white fat cells into brown fat cells. For the new study, Ding and colleagues tested more than 20,000 chemicals, with the aim of identifying ones that could do just that.

The researchers found that the anticancer drug Bex was most effective. By activating a protein called retinoid X receptor (RXR), the team found that Bex prompted a series of changes in white fat cells and muscle precursor cells that converted them into cells that mimic brown fat.

In detail, the researchers found that when Bex activated RXR, genes responsible for brown fat production were also activated, while genes associated with white fat and muscle were deactivated.

Next, the researchers set out to determine the effects of Bex on body weight in mice.

The team fed mice a high-calorie diet for 4 weeks. Half of the mice were treated with Bex, while the remaining half did not receive the drug.

Compared with the untreated mice, the rodents that received Bex showed higher amounts of brown fat, burned more calories, had less total body fat, and gained less weight, despite both groups being fed the same diet.

Taken together, the researchers believe their findings indicate that Bex could offer an effective way to boost brown fat production and reduce obesity - a condition that currently affects more than a third of adults in the United States.
""We're very excited about the prospect of using a drug to generate brown fat in the body. However, while Bex is very effective at creating brown fat cells, it is not a very specific drug, and there are several potential side effects that may arise from taking it. Our next task is to develop a safer, more targeted drug that only affects genes involved in creating brown fat.""Sheng Ding, Ph.D.

Children are far from meeting national guidelines for physical activity, and girls are at greatest risk of falling short of recommendations according to a study measuring the physical activity of 453 schoolchildren in Massachusetts during a one-week period. Led by researchers at Tufts University School of Medicine and the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, the study examined children's activity patterns during school-time and out-of-school, compared to national recommendations.

The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend that school-age children get at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) every day and the Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) recommends that 30 minutes of this activity occur during the school day. The researchers studied physical activity among children in grades three through five, not only during the school day, but also after school and on weekends to determine when children were more or less active. Measurements of the children's physical activity were taken from accelerometers worn for seven consecutive days during all waking hours. Notably, the study included a representative sample of children across several school districts in Massachusetts with 30 percent of the study participants being overweight or obese.

Researchers found that across the entire sample of 453 children, only 15 percent achieved 60 minutes of daily MVPA and even fewer, 8 percent, met the HMD recommendation of 30 minutes of MVPA during school. The greatest disparity was between boys and girls, with girls being far less likely than boys to meet both of these guidelines, with only 8 percent and 2 percent meeting total daily- and school-time recommendations respectively. As compared to normal or underweight children, overweight and obese children were also less active overall and achieved fewer minutes of MVPA during school, out-of-school, and on weekends.

""We thought that the school day would offer a protective effect where there would be few differences in activity levels between boys and girls and children in different weight categories during the school day as compared to weekends and out-of-school time. Instead, we found that girls and overweight children were less active for all measured segments, including during the school day,"" Kristie Hubbard, Ph.D., M.P.H, R.D., first and corresponding author on the study and an adjunct instructor in the department of public health and community medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine, said,

Understanding children's patterns of physical activity throughout the week can assist researchers to recommend policies and programs that increase activity levels in the settings where children live, learn, and play. The authors note that schools are uniquely positioned to encourage millions of children to increase physical activity and reduce the prevalence of obesity.

""We have to find ways to increase activity levels, especially given that few states mandate and provide opportunities for children to achieve the HMD's recommendation of 30 minutes of school-time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. In fact, many schools are cutting back on and even eliminating physical education and recess time,"" said Jennifer Sacheck, Ph.D., the study's senior author and an associate professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University,

The majority of a child's day is spent in sedentary and light physical activities (LPA) with LPA contributing the greatest amount to total activity levels. Importantly, the researchers found that LPA decreased with increasing grade level and girls were similar to boys on weekends and during out-of-school hours, but were significantly lower than boys during the school-day. This school-time disparity in LPA was not seen between normal weight and overweight/obese children.

Sacheck continued, ""We need to also continue to create opportunities for LPA during school-time and recognize that a distinct disparity exists for girls for not only MVPA, but also LPA during the school-day which is not apparent during out-of-school time. Clearly, schools need to be aware of this disparity and should focus on increasing all intensities of physical activity equally for all children across the school-day.""

Women with mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes can significantly reduce their risk of certain types of  cancer  by having their ovaries removed, according to a study in the July 12 issue of JAMA.
   
Women with a harmful mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have a high lifetime risk of  ovarian cancer  (range, 15 percent-54 percent), and mutations in either of these genes increase susceptibility to cancers of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum (abdominal lining), according to background information in the article. Women with this mutation are often advised to undergo preventive oophorectomy (surgical removal of the ovaries). The effectiveness of this intervention has not been prospectively evaluated in a large group of patients.
   
Steven A. Narod, M.D., of the Toronto-Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Center, Toronto, Ontario, and colleagues conducted a study to determine the absolute risks for developing ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers in a group of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers and estimated the risk reduction associated with salpingo-oophorectomy (surgical removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes). Women known to carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation were identified from an international registry between 1992 and 2003. A total of 1,828 carriers at 1 of 32 centers in Canada, the United States, Europe, and Israel completed questionnaires at baseline and follow-up. Participants were observed from the date of study entry until: diagnosis of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer; death; or the date of the most recent follow-up.   

After an average follow-up of 3.5 years, 50 new ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer cases were reported in the group. Of the 1,828 women, 555 (30 percent) underwent preventive removal of the ovaries and tubes prior to study entry, 490 (27 percent) underwent the procedure after entering the study, and 783 (43 percent) did not undergo the procedure. There were 32 new cancers diagnosed in women with intact ovaries.
   
The estimated cumulative incidence of peritoneal cancer is 4.3 percent at 20 years after oophorectomy. The overall (adjusted) reduction in cancer risk associated with bilateral oophorectomy is 80 percent. The researchers estimated the risk of ovarian cancer to be 62 percent for BRCA1 carriers and 18 percent for BRCA2 carriers in women up to age 75 with both ovaries intact.
   
""Women who carry a mutation in the BRCA1 gene are asked to consider prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at age 35 or thereabouts, in order to reduce the risk of ovarian, fallopian tube, and  breast cancer . Our observations support this recommendation. It may be reasonable to wait until a time closer to  menopause  to prevent ovarian and fallopian tube cancer in BRCA2 carriers but this delay will diminish the level of protection offered against breast cancer in this subgroup,"" the authors write.
   
""We estimate the magnitude of the risk reduction [from preventive removal of the ovaries and tubes] to be approximately 80 percent and the residual risk of 4 percent of peritoneal cancer is not sufficiently high to recommend against the procedure.
   
It is important that both the fallopian tubes and ovaries be removed because either site may be the origin of cancer and both organs should be examined in fine detail to rule out the presence of microscopic disease,"" the researchers conclude. (JAMA. 2006;296:185-192.)

Published in the journal Obesity, the study found drinking 500 ml of water half an hour before eating breakfast, lunch and dinner led to greater weight loss among obese adults compared with those who did not drink water before mealtimes.

""The beauty of these findings is in the simplicity. Just drinking a pint of water, three times a day, before your main meals may help reduce your weight,"" says Dr. Helen Parretti, of the University of Birmingham in the UK.

It is well established that water is essential for our health. It rids toxins from the body, transports nutrients and oxygen to cells, lubricates joints, regulates body temperature and protects the body's organs and tissues, among other functions.

Previous studies have also demonstrated other benefits for water consumption. In 2013, for example, Medical News Today reported on a study suggesting that drinking water before a mental task can boost brain performance.

Other research has also suggested water consumption may be effective for weight loss. Dr. Parretti and colleagues set out to investigate this association further.

The team enrolled 84 obese adults to their study and randomized them to one of two groups. One group was required to consume 500 ml of tap water 30 minutes before breakfast, lunch and dinner - referred to as ""preloading"" - every day for 12 weeks. The remaining participants - the control group - were asked to imagine their stomach was full prior to each main meal.

All participants received a weight management consultation at study baseline, in which they received advice on how to improve their diet and physical activity levels. All subjects also received a follow-up telephone consultation 2 weeks later.

Compared with the control group, participants who preloaded with water prior to each main meal lost an average of 1.3 kg (2.87 Ibs) more in weight. Preloading subjects lost an average of 4.3 kg (9.48 Ibs) over the 12-week period, while control subjects only lost an average of 0.8 kg (1.76 Ibs).

Dr. Parretti told MNT that the study was not designed to understand exactly how water consumption drives weight loss, but she suggested several possible mechanisms could explain the findings.

""These could include that drinking water increases your metabolic rate temporarily or that it makes you feel fuller so you then eat less at mealtimes,"" she noted.

The researchers say their findings provide ""preliminary evidence"" that drinking water prior to main meals can aid weight loss, and note that it is a simple strategy health care professionals could easily promote for overweight or obese patients.

Dr. Parretti adds:
""When combined with brief instructions on how to increase your amount of physical activity and on a healthy diet, this seems to help people to achieve some extra weight loss - at a moderate and healthy rate. It's something that doesn't take much work to integrate into our busy everyday lives.""
Dr. Paretti told MNT, however, that there are some groups of patients, such as those with heart or kidney failure, for whom consuming a pint of water before mealtimes may not be appropriate.

The team now plans to conduct a larger, longer-term trial looking to gain a better understanding of how water preloading influences weight loss.

""Losing a few extra pounds over the course of a year can be significant to an individual, and this could be an easy way to help with that weight loss,"" says Dr. Parretti. ""It's a simple message that has the potential to make a real contribution to public health.""

Antidepressant medications may be associated with suicide attempts and death in severely depressed children and adolescents but not in adults, according to an article in the August issue of Archives of General Psychiatry, one of the JAMA/Archives journals.
   
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently began requiring drug manufacturers to include a warning regarding the risk of suicidal behavior among children and teens treated with  antidepressants  after a large analysis of clinical trials revealed a potential link. It is uncertain whether there is an association between treatment with antidepressants and suicidal behavior in adults, according to background information in the article. Because relatively few completed suicides occur, suicidal behavior is used instead in studies assessing the risks associated with antidepressant medications and few studies have examined the risk of suicide attempts or deaths in patients treated with antidepressants.
   
Mark Olfson, M.D., M.P.H., College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University Medical Center and New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, and colleagues analyzed the medical records of 5,469  Medicaid  patients who were hospitalized for  depression  at least once in 1999 or 2000. The researchers first selected all cases of completed suicides (eight children and adolescents and 86 adults) and suicide attempts (263 children and adolescents, 521 adults). They then matched each case with one to five controls based on demographic information, period following hospital discharge, presence or absence of a suicide attempt prior to hospital admission, state of residence, other medication use and presence or absence of a substance abuse disorder.
   
Severely depressed children and adolescents ages 6 to 18 years were 1.5 times as likely to attempt suicide and also significantly more likely to complete suicide if they were treated with an antidepressant medication than if they were not treated with an antidepressant. More specifically, children and adolescents who died from suicide (eight cases) were more likely to have been treated with an SSRI antidepressant than their matched controls (39 controls, 37.5 percent vs. 7.7 percent). Among adults age 19 to 64 years, however, treatment with antidepressants was not associated with either suicide attempts or suicide deaths.
   
The link between completed suicides and antidepressants in young patients was based on only eight cases, and it is possible that the sickest children were more likely to be treated with such medications, skewing the results, the authors write. ""With these caveats in mind, the present findings are consistent with the recommendations for careful clinical monitoring during the treatment of depressed children and adolescents with antidepressant medications,"" they conclude. ""In practice, physicians face the difficult challenge of balancing safety concerns against evidence that depression is a key risk factor for adult and adolescent suicide and that antidepressant agents are effective for adult and adolescent depression."" (Arch Gen Psychiatry. 2006;63:865-872.)

Chances are that your children will turn out OK even though they spend hours playing video games or watching TV. This is according to Christopher Ferguson of Stetson University in the US, who led a study in Springer's journal Psychiatric Quarterly which found that there is only a negligibly small association between excessive screen time and higher levels of depression and delinquency among teenagers. Ferguson therefore believes the strict attention to limited screen time by policy makers and advocacy groups is uncalled for.

Until late last year, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended only two hours' screen time a day for youth, but dropped this recommendation from their new guidelines. This change reflects that screen time recommendations often remain best guesses, while data about the use of such recommendations are not always clear. Ferguson's team therefore sought to address gaps in previous literature by examining what levels of screen time were associated with negative outcomes in teenagers and how strong these associations were.

They analyzed data from the 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which included data from participants from Florida who were on average 16 years old. They were asked about their sleeping patterns, physical activity, how often they had meals with their family, if they experienced symptoms of depression and how much screen time they spent watching television or playing video games. The participants also reported on their grades, whether they participated in delinquent behavior, risky driving or sexual activities, used illegal substances or suffered any eating disorders.

Data from the current study suggests that children are resilient to screen consumption for up to six hours daily. When negative outcomes were noted, these were very small and in general affected males more. Time spent in front of a screen only accounted for between 0.49 percent of the variance in delinquency, 1.7 percent in depressive symptoms and 1.2 percent in average grade points. It did not have an influence on risky driving or risky sex, substance abuse or restrictive eating.

""Although an 'everything in moderation' message when discussing screen time with parents may be most productive, our results do not support a strong focus on screen time as a preventative measure for youth problem behaviors,"" says Ferguson. Results also suggest that the AAP was correct to discard their previous two-hour maximum guideline.

Ferguson believes that setting hard time limits on screen use is a fraught avenue for policy and does more to foster guilt in parents unable to meet unrealistic expectations than they do to help children. He sees more value in focusing on how media are used than on time consumption alone, as it could for instance foster learning and socialization.

He also believes that it is important that youngsters are allowed to become intimately familiar with screen technologies. ""Screens of various sorts are increasingly embedded into daily life, whether they involve education, work, socialization or personal organization,"" Ferguson explains. ""Setting narrow limits on screen time may not keep up with the myriad ways in which screens have become essential to modern life.""

A new study revealed that your cereal choice at breakfast might have an impact on how much you eat for lunch. Newly published research in the Journal of the American College of Nutritionshowed that a hearty bowl of instant oatmeal helped curb food intake at lunch better than a leading oat-based, cold cereal -- even when each bowl provided the same number of calories.

The statistically significant results of the randomized, controlled crossover study (n=47) showed that a 250-calorie instant oatmeal serving (with an additional 113 calories of skim milk) enhanced satiety and feelings of fullness, reduced the desire to eat and may even lead to a lower caloric intake at lunch, compared to a 250-calorie serving of cold, oat-based cereal, also served with an additional 113 calories of skim milk.

""The satiety benefits of instant oatmeal alone were important findings,"" remarked lead author Candida Rebello, MS, RD, of Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. ""When we took it a step further and evaluated the intake four hours post-breakfast, we found that after consuming instant oatmeal, the participants chose to eat significantly less at lunch compared to those who ate the oat-based, cold cereal.""

After an analysis of the types of fiber in each cereal, the researchers suspected that the higher molecular viscosity of the beta-glucan in the instant oatmeal contributed to its satiating effect over the oat-based, cold cereal. Authors stated that the processing of the cold cereal might lead to changes in the oat fiber that reduced its ability to enhance satiety.

Researchers presented the participants with a lunch meal of their choice - turkey, ham, roast beef or vegetable patty sandwiches and a calorie-free or calorie-containing beverage, alongside potato crisps and cookies. The lunches offered ranged from 2,600 to 2,800 calories and participants were told to ""eat to satisfaction."" Total calorie intake was significantly lower following consumption of instant oatmeal compared to the cold cereal, as were fat and protein intake. Grams of carbohydrate and total weight of the foods were not significantly different.

""The recent 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans Committee Report emphasized the importance of eating breakfast for all Americans - and we know that instant oatmeal is a popular and convenient choice,"" comments Marianne O'Shea, PhD, Director of the Quaker Oats Center of Excellence. ""The fact that choosing instant oatmeal over a cold cereal may also help Americans curb their intake at lunch is especially encouraging.""

Dramatic improvements in air quality in U.S. cities since the 1990s may not be enough to ensure normal lung function in children, according to new research published in the April 15 American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, a journal of the American Thoracic Society.

In ""Lifetime Exposure to Ambient Air Pollution and Lung Function in Children,"" researchers report that children exposed to higher levels of air pollution, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and soot (black carbon), had worse lung function than those living in less polluted areas. By age eight, the lung function of children living within 100 meters of a major roadway was on average 6 percent lower than that of children living 400 meters or more away.

""Few studies have examined childhood exposure to air pollution after the dramatic improvements in air quality of the 1990's to see if exposure to air pollution at these lower levels is linked to children's lung function,"" said lead author Mary B. Rice, MD, MPH, an instructor at Harvard Medical School, who noted that PM2.5 levels in Boston have declined by more than 30 percent between 1996 and 2006.

Researchers studied 614 children born to mothers who enrolled between 1999 and 2002 in Project Viva, a long-term study of women's and children's health in eastern Massachusetts. Authors calculated the distance from the child's home to the nearest major highway, and estimated first year of life, lifetime and prior-year exposure to PM2.5, using satellite measurements. They also estimated first year of life, lifetime and prior-year exposure to black carbon using 148 monitoring stations.

At age eight, children underwent lung function tests. Researchers found:

  
""These important findings are from a novel study combining modern modeling of exposures to air pollution with robust measurements of lung function, conducted in a community with pollutant levels now under EPA standards,"" wrote Cora S. Sack, MD, and Joel D. Kaufman, MD, MPH, of the University of Washington, in an accompanying editorial. ""This adds to the urgency for more work to understand the impacts of these low-level exposures on human health.""

Study limitations include the fact that lung function was measured only once and a relatively homogenous study population.

The study will follow these children into adolescence. ""We plan to evaluate if the benefits of cleaner air endure by investigating if children with the greatest improvements in air quality continue to have better lung function than their peers in the teen years."" Dr. Rice said.

While it is well known that smoking causes lung cancer, heavy smokers with diabetes are also at increased risk of death from causes other than lung cancer, according to a study being presented next week at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Diabetes is a chronic illness in which there are high levels of glucose in the blood. More than 29 million people in the U.S. have diabetes, up from the previous estimate of 26 million in 2010, according to a report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One in four people with diabetes doesn't know he or she has it. Having diabetes can also put people at risk for numerous other health complications.

To determine the extent to which diabetes is associated with deaths from lung cancer, other cancers, and other causes among heavy smokers, researchers examined the risk for all-cause mortality among people with and without diabetes within the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a massive, multicenter trial that compared low-dose helical CT with chest X-ray for early detection of lung cancer in current and former heavy smokers.

""In our study, we found a statistically significant link between diabetes and all-cause deaths, non-lung cancer deaths and lung cancer deaths in women,"" said Kavita Garg, M.D., professor of radiology from the University of Colorado - Denver.

For the study, Dr. Garg and colleagues looked at data from 53,454 participants in the NLST and identified 5,174 participants who reported having diabetes at screening.

They conducted an analysis of the relative risk for overall mortality, lung cancer mortality, and non-lung cancer mortality associated with diabetes, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and pack-years of smoking. Over the course of the study, there were 3,936 total deaths, including 1,021 from lung cancer and 826 from cancers not of the lung.

Participants with diabetes tended to be older, reported more pack-years of smoking, and had a higher BMI than those without diabetes. There were 650 deaths (12.6 percent of patients) among participants with diabetes and 3,286 deaths (6.8 percent of patients) among participants without diabetes.

""We found that diabetes doubles the risk for all-cause mortality and non-lung cancer mortality among heavy smokers,"" Dr. Garg said. ""We also found that women with diabetes have an increased risk of lung-cancer mortality, but did not find the same effect in men.""

The researchers continue to analyze data in an effort to better understand the underlying cause. In the meantime, Dr. Garg emphasizes the importance of taking control of diabetes and undergoing lung cancer screening if you're a smoker.

""Patients have to take care of their diabetes to maximize the benefit of CT screening for lung cancer,"" she said. ""It truly makes a magnitude of difference in mortality risk.""

From an analysis of more than 1,000 students, researchers found that children exposed to harsh parenting were more likely to engage in delinquency and other negative behaviors as teenagers, which was associated with lower educational achievement by the age of 21.

Study leader Rochelle F. Hentges, of the Department of Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh, PA, and colleagues recently reported their findings in the journal Child Development.

This is not the first study to document the negative implications of harsh parenting - generally defined as shouting, hitting, or making physical or abusive threats as a form of punishment - on the psychosocial behavior of offspring.

One study published in PLOS One in 2014, for example, associated harsh parenting with greater risk of emotional and behavioral problems in offspring, while a more recent study published in the Journal of Family Psychology linked harsh parenting with poorer learning and lower academic achievement.

For their study, Hentges and colleagues set out to pinpoint the behaviors that might lead to lower educational attainment among individuals exposed to harsh parenting in childhood.

The researchers analyzed the data of 1,060 students from the Maryland Adolescent Development in Context Study, following them from the 7th grade until the age of 21.

Through the duration of the study, the students were required to report their exposure to harsh parenting, their social interaction with peers, sexual behavior, and delinquency. 

The educational attainment of each student was assessed at the age of 21, determined through the number of school years completed.

""We believe our study is the first to use children's life histories as a framework to examine how parenting affects children's educational outcomes via relationships with peers, sexual behavior, and delinquency,"" notes Hentges.

Compared with students exposed to more lenient parenting in the 7th grade, students who were exposed to harsh parenting were more likely to deem their peers to be more important than other responsibilities - such as adhering to their parents' rules - in the 9th grade.

As a result, the team found that these harshly parented students were more likely to partake in risky behaviors in the 11th grade. These included more frequent sexual behavior, hitting, stealing, and other delinquencies.

These behaviors, in turn, were associated with low educational attainment at the age of 21.
""In our study, harsh parenting was related to lower educational attainment through a set of complex cascading processes that emphasized present-oriented behaviors at the cost of future-oriented educational goals.""Rochelle F. Hentges
Hentges hypothesizes that adolescents whose needs have not been met by their parents ""may seek validation from peers.""

""This may include turning to peers in unhealthy ways, which may lead to increased aggression and delinquency, as well as early sexual behavior at the expense of long-term goals such as education,"" she adds.

Study co-author Ming-Te Wang, professor of psychology in education at the University of Pittsburgh, suggests that there are a number of interventions that might improve the educational attainment of youths who are subject to harsh parenting.

For example, these adolescents may benefit from teaching techniques that focus on hands-on learning or group activities, as well as programs that offer education and help in relation to sexual behavior, delinquency, and unhealthy relationships with peers.

Children who are diagnosed with diabetes before the age of seven develop a more aggressive form of the disease than that seen in teenagers, new research has revealed.

A team led by the University of Exeter Medical School has found for the first time that, while children aged six or under are left with very few insulin-producing beta cells in their pancreas when diagnosed, those with onset of symptomatic type 1 diabetes as teenagers still retain large numbers of these cells. The discovery could lead to new approaches for treatment of the disease.

The team worked with the University of Oslo and the network of Pancreatic Organ Donors (nPOD) to analyse the largest ever collection of biobanked pancreas samples from people with type 1 diabetes. The study, funded by the European Union and the JDRF is published online today in the journal Diabetes. It provides the first clear evidence that children who are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of six years or under develop a more aggressive form of the disease. A condition known as insulitis, representing an inflammatory process, kills off nearly all the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas of the young children. However, the researchers found that progression of the disease is radically different in those diagnosed as teenagers or beyond, who retain unexpectedly large numbers of beta cells at diagnosis - although they are no longer working as they should.

Professor Noel Morgan, of the University of Exeter Medical School, said: ""This is incredibly exciting, and could open the doors to new treatments for young people who develop diabetes. It was previously thought that teenagers with type 1 diabetes had lost around 90 per cent of their beta cells but, by looking in their pancreas, we have discovered that this is not true. In fact, those diagnosed in their teens still have many beta cells left - this suggests that the cells are dormant, but not dead. If we can find a way to reactivate these cells so that they resume insulin release, we may be able to slow or even reverse progression of this terrible disease.""

In the UK alone, around 30,000 young people have Type 1 Diabetes, and diagnoses among the younger age group are escalating fast. The team's discovery also has important implications for this younger group - for example, most trials have focussed mainly on halting the immune attack in older patients, where the team finds that insulitis may be less severe. In future, it will be important to assess whether younger children might benefit most from such approaches, as they have the more aggressive disease.

The team analysed a subset of human samples from people with type 1 diabetes within the Exeter Archival Diabetes Biobank, originally compiled by Professor Alan Foulis a co-author on the study, which he bequeathed to the University of Exeter Medical School when he retired from the University of Glasgow. They then checked and extended their results against larger databases of samples from America and Europe, which confirmed their results.

Dr Sarah Richardson, of the University of Exeter Medical School was co-author on the study. She said: ""For trials to be effective, we have to understand the underlying causes of the disease. Until now, most research into the onset of type 1 diabetes has been carried out in animal models. While that's extremely valuable, there are clear differences in human pathology. Here in Exeter, we now have this incredible resource of a unique biobank of human samples from people with type 1 diabetes, which means we're able to see what's really going on in the human body. We're working with partners across the world to make major advances in this research area. Our next step is to investigate why diabetes progresses differently in younger and older children, with a view to understanding how we could treat both groups more effectively.""

Karen Addington, UK Chief Executive of type 1 diabetes charity JDRF, said: ""A child diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of five faces up to 19,000 insulin injections and 50,000 finger-prick blood tests before they reach the age of 18. But research can bring us closer to the day we find the cure.""

Certain viruses, such as influenza, could survive on children's toys long enough to result in exposures, placing children at risk for getting infectious diseases, according to researchers at Georgia State University.

The researchers tested how long an enveloped virus could survive on pieces of a flexible plastic children's toy, a squeaking frog. They were able to recover infectious virions (complete viral particles) from the toy up to 24 hours after the toy's contamination at 60 percent relative humidity, and up to 10 hours at 40 percent relative humidity.

These findings show enveloped viruses could survive on toys long enough to result in exposures. Enveloped viruses have a protective outer layer that may help them survive and infect other cells. Examples of such viruses include influenza and Coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).

The study is published online in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal.

""People don't really think about getting viruses from inanimate objects,"" said lead author Richard Bearden II, who holds a master of science degree in biology from Georgia State. ""They think about getting them from other people. Children are vulnerable to contracting infectious disease because they put their hands and foreign objects in their mouths, and their immune systems aren't fully developed.""

Toys may be an important channel for the transmission of viral diseases among children. Previous studies have found viral contamination of shared toys in daycares, doctor's offices and homes. In particular, toys in common play areas in healthcare settings have been implicated as vehicles for outbreaks of viral illness.

However, it has remained unknown how long enveloped viruses can survive on inanimate objects, making it difficult to assess the potential risk of infection and design effective control measures, such as disinfection. This study investigated how long it takes for an enveloped virus to become inactive on the surface of a children's toy at typical indoor temperatures and relative humidity levels.

For the study, researchers used an enveloped bacteriophage, a virus that infects bacteria, to model what the survival of viruses that infect humans may look like. They placed the virus on the toy in controlled humidity environments at 22 degrees Celsius at either 40 percent or 60 percent relative humidity.

Over a 24-hour period, one percent of the virus remained infectious on the toy at 60-percent relative humidity, showing a 99-percent reduction in the number of infectious viruses.

""It's likely the research team could have retrieved infectious virions beyond 24 hours,"" Bearden said.

The virus was less stable at 40-percent relative humidity, which is more common in indoor environments. In the first two hours, 0.01 percent of the virus remained, showing a 99.9-percent reduction in the number of infectious viruses. Researchers were able to recover 0.0001 percent of the infectious virus at 10 hours.

Still, if any virus remains, there's a risk that children could become ill. Indoor relative humidity can vary based on where a person lives, so it's important to concentrate on preventing the spread of disease, Bearden said.

""I think the main focus should be for parents, daycare facilities, doctor's offices and other places where children share toys to implement some type of strategy for decontamination to make sure those toys aren't a reservoir for disease,"" he said.

For instance, toys that are shared should be decontaminated often. Household bleach is among the best cleaning solutions. Eliminating toys from waiting rooms in healthcare settings is also recommended. A decontamination plan could also include door handles, elevator buttons and other commonly shared surfaces, Bearden said.

Recording artists are frequently the face of commercial products - and children and adolescents are frequently their target audience. Now, a new study by researchers at NYU Langone Medical Center finds that the vast majority of the food and beverage products marketed by some of the most popular music stars are unhealthy.

And this type of advertising is contributing to the alarming rise in childhood and teen obesity, the authors warn.

Soda and other sugary drinks, fast food and sweets are among the most common food and beverage products endorsed by famous music personalities, according to the descriptive study, which publishes June 6 in Pediatrics. Equally alarming, none of the music stars identified in the study endorsed fruits, vegetables, or whole grains. Only one endorsed a natural food deemed healthy - pistachios.

This is believed to be the first study to use a rigorous nutritional analysis to evaluate healthfulness of food and drinks marketed by music stars, reviewing dozens of advertisements that were disseminated over a 14-year period. Lead author Marie Bragg, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone, conducted a study three years ago of celebrity athlete endorsements using similar methods.

""Because of our nation's childhood and teenage obesity public health crises, it is important to raise awareness about how companies are using celebrities popular with these audiences to market their unhealthy products,"" said Dr. Bragg, who is also a faculty member at the NYU College of Global Public Health. ""Research has already shown that food advertising leads to overeating, and the food industry spends $1.8 billion per year marketing to youth alone.""

To identify popular music stars, the investigators went through Billboard Magazine's ""Hot 100"" song charts from 2013 and 2014. The researchers also verified their popularity and marketing appeal with teens by reviewing Teen Choice Award winners, and quantified the number of YouTube video views associated with the celebrities' food and nonalcoholic beverage brand endorsements.

The investigators then catalogued every endorsement between 2000 and 2014 using AdScope, an advertisement database that contains all forms of ads, including television, magazine, and radio. They also searched for official commercials or endorsements on YouTube and in media sources. Endorsements were defined to include a celebrity's participation in a concert sponsored by a product.

After sorting the endorsements into different marketing categories, the authors found that 65 of 163 identified pop stars were associated with 57 different food and beverage brands. Food and nonalcoholic beverages were the second-largest endorsement category, comprising 18 percent of endorsements and ranking after consumer goods at 26 percent and ahead of retail at 11 percent.

To assess nutritional value of the endorsed food products, the investigators analyzed nutrition information on food labels using the Nutrient Profile Model (NPM), which has been used in other food marketing research studies and provides a score that represents nutrient content. Twenty-one out of 26 food products - or 81 percent - were deemed ""nutrient poor.""

The investigators determined a beverage's healthfulness by looking at calories from added sugar. Of 69 beverages endorsed, 49 or 71 percent were sugar-sweetened. Full-calorie soft drinks were the most commonly endorsed in the category. In contrast, water-related endorsements appeared only three times.

Food & beverage companies spend $2 billion a year on youth-targeted ads, with American children seeing approximately 4,700 ads each year and teens viewing 5,900 ads per year, according to Institute of Medicine research. There were about 313 million views of the YouTube video versions for food and beverage endorsements associated with celebrities in this study's sample, although unique views could not be counted. Celebrity food endorsements promote higher product preference, and exposure to any kind of food advertising is linked to ""excessive consumption,"" according to research.

""These celebrity endorsement deals are often worth millions of dollars each, suggesting companies find them critical for promoting products,"" said Dr. Bragg.

Food and beverage marketing has been identified in a variety of epidemiologic and psychology studies as a significant environmental contributor to childhood obesity. In 2012, over one-third of children and adolescents were overweight or obese, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Public Health Service.

Although many food and beverage companies have taken voluntary pledges not to target children under 12 years old with certain marketing, teens are not included.

""Given the heavy targeting of adolescents and the amount of money they spend on foods and beverages, voluntary food marketing reduction pledges should expand to include teens,"" said Dr. Bragg. ""This also would be consistent with American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations, which encourages pediatricians to support local and national efforts to reduce food marketing while also counseling patients to limit screen time.""

Celebrities also should use their influence to promote more healthful marketing and encourage consumption of healthy foods, the authors suggest.

""The popularity of music celebrities among adolescents makes them uniquely poised to serve as positive role models,"" said Alysa N. Miller, MPH, study co-author and research coordinator in the Department of Population Health. ""Celebrities should be aware that their endorsements could exacerbate society's struggle with obesity - and they should endorse healthy products instead.""

A recent study by investigators at the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases at the National Institutes of Health measured how much artificial sweetener is absorbed into the blood stream by children and adults after drinking a can of diet soda. Results of this study are published in Toxicological & Environmental Chemistry.

The team measured the artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame-potassium, which are found in a wide range of packaged foods and beverages. These artificial sweeteners, also including saccharin and aspartame, have received a lot of attention lately because it has been found that they are not inert chemicals with a sweet taste, but active substances that can affect the metabolism.

Despite their approval as food additives following the submission of detailed safety data to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), concerns about their safety and especially about their long-term health effects remain. Artificial sweetener use is increasing worldwide because it is universally accepted that high sugar consumption promotes a variety of health problems, including obesity and diabetes. The food industry responds to the consumer demand, and increasingly replaces sugar with artificial sweeteners in order to provide tasty goods with lower sugar content. Most consumers expect that weight loss will result from switching to artificial sweeteners (because they contain no or fewer calories), but paradoxically the opposite may happen. 

Given this background, the authors performed a study to extend previous investigations into plasma concentrations of sucralose and acesulfame-potassium. Artificial sweetener concentrations were measured among adults following ingestion of various doses of sucralose with or without acesulfame-potassium, both in diet soda and mixed in seltzer or plain water. Results obtained in adults were then compared with measurements obtained in children.

The study comprised 22 adults aged 18-45 and 11 children aged 6-12 with no known medical conditions and who were not using any medications, enrolled in a randomized same-subject crossover study. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).

The results of the study demonstrate that, compared to adults, children had double the concentrations of plasma sucralose after ingestion of a single twelve ounce can diet soda. The same research team previously found that these artificial sweeteners were also present in breast milk when mothers ingested foods, drinks, medicines or other products that contained artificial sweeteners.  Since infants have less ability to clear substances from their blood stream via the kidneys (lower glomerular filtration rate up to age 2 years), the authors speculate that the infants' artificial sweetener blood levels may be proportionately even higher.

These results are important because early life exposure to artificial sweeteners may influence a child's future taste preferences, diet and metabolic fate. Since it is known that children generally prefer more sweetness than adults, they are especially vulnerable to the intense sweetness provided by artificial sweeteners.

The findings of this study also highlight the fact that some people absorb relatively small amounts of artificial sweeteners and some exorbitantly high amounts. Overall, this study will help others with the design and interpretation of crucial future research to better understand what artificial sweeteners do to our health.

Those who like to eat ham and brats every day, significantly increase their risk of getting  colorectal cancer . In 

contrast, if fish is a regular part of one's diet, colorectal cancer risk is lowered. Earlier investigation results had 

already suggested these interrelations. The evaluation of a study with about half a million participants has now confirmed 

the hypothesis.    

Study participants from ten European countries have been questioned about their dietary habits and lifestyles since 1992 in a 

study named ?EPIC? (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition). These data are studied in relation to the 

incidence of new  cancer  cases among participants. EPIC study centers in Germany are: the German Cancer Research Center 

(Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, DKFZ), Heidelberg, and the German Institute of Human Nutrition (Deutsches Institut f?r 

Ern?hrungsforschung Potsdam-Rehbr?cke, DIfE).    

Epidemiologists of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Lyon, France, which coordinates EPIC, jointly 

with colleagues from other EPIC study centers, have now published results on the relationship between meat and fish 

consumption and colorectal cancer risk. The analysis is based on 1.329 cases of rectal and  colon cancer  that have been newly 

diagnosed among participants since the study was started.    
Study subjects who had eaten a lot of what is called ?red? meat (i.e., pork, beef, veal, and lamb) or such meat products were 

diagnosed with colorectal cancer more often than persons who ate only little of it. With fish, things are exactly opposite: 

Those who ate a lot of fish were found to have a significantly lower colorectal cancer risk compared to those with a low fish 

consumption. The consumption of poultry played no role for colorectal cancer incidence.    

Researchers estimate that the risk of colorectal cancer increases by 49% per 100 grams of daily consumed ?red? meat. An 

increase in daily sausage consumption by 100 grams elevates the risk even by 70%. In contrast, 100 grams more fish daily 

reduce the disease risk by one half. 
These figures take account of the influence of different factors such as gender,  body weight , alcohol comsumption, physical 

exercise or smoking on the disease risk. In addition, the data were processed using a method that reduces inaccuracies in the 

information provided by study participants on their dietary habits.    

The scientists propose different explanations for the influence of the consumption of meat and meat products on colorectal 

cancer development. Recent studies suggest that the intake of iron contained in meat may contribute to risk elevation, 

because iron can promote the formation of harmful nitroso compounds in the body. On average, ?red? meat or meat products have 

a higher iron content than poultry, which may explain why consumption of the latter may not have influenced colorectal cancer 

risk in this study. The protective effect of fish consumption may be caused by specific long chain, polyunsaturated  omega-3  

fatty acids.    
Regarding meat and meat products, the results now published confirm evidence provided by earlier studies. They also provide 

renewed evidence suggesting a positive role of fish in human  nutrition . This is how Professor Heiner Boeing and PD Dr. Jakob 

Linseisen, EPIC study directors in Potsdam and Heidelberg, commented the results. These results should alert the Germans, 

said the experts: Germany ranks first in the consumption of sausage products in Europe. Thus, the Germans would benefit most 

from reducing their sausage consumption.

University of Rochester Medical Center scientists have discovered new essential information about omega 3 fatty acids contained in fish oil and how they could be used for asthma patients.

In a paper published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation Insight, researchers using cell cultures from local asthma patients, found that:

Lead author Richard P. Phipps, Ph.D., the Wright Family Research Professor of Environmental Medicine, and his lab had previously shown that certain fatty acids contained in fish oil regulate the function of immune cells (B cells). They wanted to further investigate the effects on asthma.

People with asthma have an imbalance between molecules that dampen inflammation and those that increase inflammation. Using steroids as treatment controls the inflammation and relieves symptoms, but does not cure the underlying disease.

Phipps and his team collected blood from 17 patients at UR Medicine's Mary Parkes Asthma Center and isolated their B immune cells in the laboratory to explore the impact of pure omega-3-derived products on IgE and other molecules that fuel the disease. Co-authors Nina Kim, Ph.D., and Patricia Sime, M.D., the C. Jane and C. Robert Distinguished Chair in Pulmonary Medicine, conducted much of the laboratory and clinical work, and compared the results of the 17 patients to donors of healthy blood cells.

Most of the patients who volunteered for the study were taking corticosteroids in either pill form or by inhaler, depending upon severity of their asthma. Results showed that all responded to the omega-3 fatty acids to some degree, as evidenced by a reduction in the levels of IgE antibodies. But unexpectedly, Phipps said, the cells from a small subset of patients who were taking oral steroids were less sensitive to the omega-3 treatment.

Steroids are usually a very effective treatment for asthma. However, although the science is in the early stages, it appears that when corticosteroids are used steadily, in some cases the steroids reduce some of the body's natural ability to fight asthma-related inflammation, Phipps said.

The URMC discovery coincides with a New England Journal of Medicine study in late December 2016, showing that prenatal exposure to fish oil reduced the risk of wheeze and asthma in children. Phipps noted that the fish oil used as a dietary supplement in the NEJM study was a special high-quality preparation - and that consumers should use caution when buying fish oil because not all fish oil is the same.

""You really need high-quality, standardized material that's been processed and stored correctly before comparing results from one study to another study,"" Phipps said. ""Our study used the pure, biologically active products in fish oil, known as 17-HDHA, and we've provided a clear line of evidence for why intake of high-quality fish oil is good.""

Omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to have many health benefits. Once ingested, they convert to special pro-resolving mediators that halt inflammation without also suppressing the immune system. They can be found in foods such as flax seed oil, salmon, tuna, anchovies, and walnuts.

Funds from the National Institute of Health, the Mary Parkes Asthma Center, and the Rob Quivey Oral Biology Training Grant supported the research.

Senior author Femke Rutters, Ph.D., of the VU Medical Centre in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and colleagues report their findings in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

According to the American Diabetes Association, around 29.1 million people in the United States have diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the condition, which arises when the body is unable to use insulin effectively. Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body does not produce insulin. 

Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas that transports glucose from the bloodstream into the body's cells, where it is used for energy. If beta cells cannot produce enough insulin or the body does not correctly respond to the hormone, this results in high blood glucose levels.

Obesity and lack of exercise are two lifestyle factors known to raise the risk of diabetes. For this latest study, Rutters and colleagues set out to determine whether sleep duration could also play a role in diabetes development.

The team analyzed data of 788 healthy men and women aged 30-60 years from across 19 European countries. All subjects were part of the European Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular Disease (EGIR-RISC) study.

The researchers assessed how many hours sleep participants got each night, and their physical activity levels were assessed using a single-axis accelerometer - a movement sensor.

Subjects' risk of diabetes was assessed using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, which measures how well the body uses insulin.

Compared with men who slept an average of 7 hours each night - in line with current recommendations - men who slept fewer or more than 7 hours a night had poorer glucose metabolism.

""In men, sleeping too much or too little was related to less responsiveness of the cells in the body to insulin, reducing glucose uptake and thus increasing the risk of developing diabetes in the future,"" explains Rutters.

In addition, men who slept fewer or more than 7 hours a night had higher blood sugar levels than those who slept an average of 7 hours.

No such associations were identified among women, the researchers report.

In fact, the team found that the cells of women who slept fewer or more than 7 hours a night were more likely to respond to insulin, and their beta cells had better function, suggesting that lack of sleep does not raise women's diabetes risk.

Still, the researchers say their findings highlight the importance of getting a good night's sleep - particularly for men.
""Even when you are healthy, sleeping too much or too little can have detrimental effects on your health. This research shows how important sleep is to a key aspect of health - glucose metabolism.""Femke Rutters, Ph.D.

Two new studies in the February 2 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute have found that sun exposure may 

have a beneficial influence on some types of  cancer . One study found an association between sun exposure and increased 

survival from  melanoma , a potentially deadly form of  skin cancer  for which sun exposure is a risk factor, while the other 

found an association between sun exposure and a reduced risk of non-Hodgkin  lymphoma .    
Solar radiation is a major risk factor for melanoma. The incidence of and mortality from melanoma have been increasing over 

the last 50 years in all developed countries with large Caucasian populations. But as the incidence of melanoma increases, so 

does survival, suggesting the possibility that increasing sun exposure increases melanoma survival in addition to melanoma 

incidence. However, increased early detection of melanoma might also explain the increased survival.    
To examine the relationship between sun exposure, early detection, and melanoma survival, Marianne Berwick, Ph.D., M.P.H., of 

the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, and colleagues conducted a population-based, case-control study of more than 500 

patients from the Connecticut Tumor Registry who had been diagnosed with melanoma in the late 1980s.    
Three measures of sun exposure-sunburn, high intermittent sun exposure, and solar elastosis (an indicator of the skin\'s sun 

damage)-and a personal history of skin awareness (a measure of early detection) were all inversely associated with death from 

melanoma. Melanoma patients with higher levels of sun exposure or skin awareness were less likely to die. In addition, both 

solar elastosis and skin awareness were independently associated with increased survival from melanoma, even after adjusting 

for certain melanoma characteristics, such as lesion thickness and location. The authors conclude that sun exposure is 

associated with increased survival from melanoma.    
\""It would be reasonable to speculate... that the apparently beneficial relationship between sun exposure and survival from 

melanoma could be mediated by  vitamin D ,\"" Berwick and colleagues write. \""However, an alternative hypothesis is that sun 

exposure induces less aggressive melanomas by inducing melanization and increasing DNA repair capacity, both of which might 

reduce further mutational changes in a melanoma. Which, if either, hypothesis is more plausible remains to be determined.\"" 
  
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma has also been on the rise worldwide, and it has been suggested that increasing ultraviolet (UV) 

radiation and sun exposure may be partly responsible. To investigate this hypothesis, Karin Ekstr?m Smedby, of the Karolinska 

Institute in Stockholm, and colleagues conducted a population-based, case-control study in Denmark and Sweden in which they 

obtained detailed information on history of UV exposure and other risk factors for lymphoma from more than 3,000 lymphoma 

patients and a similar number of control subjects.    
They found that increased exposure to UV radiation through sunbathing and sunburns was associated with a decrease, rather 

than an increase, in the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Increased UV exposure was also associated, although more weakly, with 

a decreased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma.    
\""[These] results suggest an inverse association between UV light exposure and non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk,\"" Smedby and 

colleagues write. \""However, before this association can be considered causal we need further confirmatory data from other 

epidemiologic studies and, ideally, a better understanding of possible biologic mechanisms,\"" including UV-induced systemic 

immune modulation and the photo-initiation of  vitamin  D production.    
In an editorial, William J. Blot, Ph.D., of the International Epidemiology Institute in Rockville, Md., and colleagues

Young adults from low-income families who were in full-time early educational child care from infancy to age 5 report fewer symptoms of  depression  than their peers who were not in this type of care. The early educational intervention also appears to have protected the children to some extent against the negative effects of their home environments. These findings highlight the value of investing in high quality early childhood experiences for low-income children.
   
Those are the conclusions of a new study conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Washington at Seattle. The study is published in the May/June 2007 issue of the journal  Child Development. 
   
Research has shown a relationship between poverty in early childhood and an increased risk for  mental health  problems in adulthood. A number of early intervention programs have been found to enhance the cognitive development and academic outcomes of children living in poverty, but less is known about the long-term effects of these programs on children's mental health.
   
Some 111 children were enrolled as infants in the Abecedarian Project, a North Carolina-based study in which high-risk children were randomly assigned to early educational child care from infancy to age 5; a control group did not receive such care. All children came from low-income families with demographic factors known to predict developmental delays or academic problems; 98 percent were African-American. As part of the study, developmental and demographic data were collected regularly during the early childhood years with follow-up assessments in adolescence and young adulthood.
   
The study found that young adults who had participated in the child care program as young children had fewer symptoms of depression than those who had not taken part. The study also found that early child care moderated the effect of the children's home environment, offsetting the relationship between the early home environment and subsequent feelings of depression.
   
In contrast, among the young adults who did not attend the early care program as young children, the more negative the early home environment, the greater the likelihood that these individuals would show signs of depression.
   
""The early intervention, which was largely child centered, does not appear to have changed home environments,"" according to Frances A. Campbell, senior scientists at the FPG Child Development Institute at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and one of the authors of the study. ""Rather it buffered, or protected, the treated children from the adverse effects of less optimal early home environments on depressive symptoms. Evidence indicating that good early childhood experiences can make a positive difference in the mental health of individuals born into poverty underscores the importance of investing in high quality early childhood experiences for poor children.""

Using someone else's medication is the most common form of prescription stimulant misuse among adolescents, according to a University of Florida Health study, which found that 88 percent of teens who used the drugs non-medically in the past 30 days said they had obtained the medications from someone else.
 
""In the last 10 years a number of new stimulant medications have been approved for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, treatment, and the expansion of this market, coupled with the increasing rates of ADHD diagnosis, provides greater availability of these drugs,"" said lead author Yanning Wang, M.S., who conducted the study as part of her thesis work for a master's degree in the department of epidemiology at the UF College of Public Health and Health Professions and the College of Medicine. ""This raises concerns about the possible non-medical use or abuse of these medications.""
 
The findings appeared in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence.
 
Drugs such as Adderall, Concerta and Ritalin are typically prescribed to help patients with ADHD stay focused and to control behavior problems. When taken incorrectly or without a prescription, the stimulants can increase blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature and decrease sleep and appetite, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. At high doses, they can lead to cardiovascular problems.
 
Wang, now a statistical research coordinator in the UF College of Medicine's department of pathology, immunology and laboratory medicine and the department of health outcomes and policy, analyzed data from the National Monitoring of Adolescent Prescription Stimulants Study, which surveyed more than 11,000 youth ages 10 to 18 living in and around 10 U.S. cities. Interviewers recruited participants at entertainment venues, such as shopping malls, movie theaters, sports and recreation centers, arcades and skate parks. The study was carried out during four waves between 2008 and 2011.
 
About 7 percent of all respondents reported they had used a prescription stimulant during the past 30 days. Among those 750 adolescents, 54 percent reported some type of non-medical use, such as taking more pills than prescribed by their doctor, using someone else's medication, or smoking, snorting or sniffing the medication instead of taking by mouth. Using someone else's medication was the most frequently reported form of misuse at 88 percent, followed by taking more medication than prescribed at 39 percent.
 
""It is so important for physicians and parents to counsel youth who have prescription stimulants to never share their medications,"" said co-author Linda B. Cottler, Ph.D., M.P.H., a dean's professor, chair of the department of epidemiology and Wang's mentor.
 
The UF study was unique in that it differentiated two different types of non-medical users: those who exclusively used stimulants non-medically, and teens who reported both using their own stimulant medication as prescribed and some form of non-medical use within the past 30 days. This group of medical and non-medical users is an important group for future study, Wang said, because they could be serving as a source for shared or traded prescription stimulant medication.
 
Teens who only used stimulants non-medically reported more conduct problems at home and school and higher rates of using other substances, including tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs. That group was also more likely to have close friends who have tried other drugs, suggesting they are in ""a circle of risk taking,"" said Cottler, also the College of Public Health and Health Professions' associate dean for research.
 
Understanding differences in behavior and friend networks between the two types of non-medical users can help experts develop targeted educational programs to prevent prescription stimulant misuse, said Wang, who is currently working with Florida's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program to analyze multiple sources of data to understand current and emerging trends of prescription drug abuse.

When mothers experience symptoms of  depression  after the birth of their children they are less likely to breastfeed, play with, read to or perform other interactive parenting tasks with their newborns, according to a study conducted by researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Columbia University. The nationwide study is the largest to examine whether a mother's depressive symptoms impact her parenting practices post partum. The results appear in the March 2006 edition of Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.
   
""Maternal depressive symptoms are very common in early infancy. We found nearly 18 percent of the mothers in our study reported experiencing some symptoms of depression two to four months after the birth of their children,"" said Cynthia S. Minkovitz, MD, MPP, corresponding author of the study and a professor in the Department of Population and Family Health Sciences at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""These symptoms clearly have an unfavorable impact on a mother's parenting practices, particularly those that involve active engagement with the child. Our results highlight the importance of screening new mothers for depressive symptoms.""
   
Results from the study showed that 43.8 percent of mothers with depressive symptoms were likely to be breastfeeding at two to four months post partum compared to 56.9 percent of mothers who did not have depressive symptoms. At two to four months following birth, 87.4 percent of mothers with depressive symptoms were likely to play with their infants at least once a day compared to 91.9 percent of mothers without symptoms, and 22.4 percent of mothers with depressive symptoms were likely to show their children books compared to 28.2 percent without.
   
The presence of depressive symptoms did not appear to impact a mother's adherence to safety practices, such as lowering the temperature of the home water heater and placing the infant in the correct sleeping position. In these instances, the researchers did not find any significant differences between mothers with and without depressive symptoms after factors such as the mothers' age, income and level of education were considered. Overall, adherence to safety practices was high among all study participants.
   
The results of the study are based on an analysis of 4,874 mothers from 15 pediatric care sites nationwide conducted by Minkovitz, lead author Kathryn Taafe McLearn, PhD, formerly with the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, and colleagues. The participants were drawn from the National Evaluation of Healthy Steps for Young Children and were surveyed about their backgrounds when they entered the study, and then about their depressive symptoms and parenting practices two to four months following the birth of their child.

Convincing kids to choose vegetables becomes easier when you deploy a team of animated characters to sell them on the good stuff, new research has found.

Miki Mushroom, Zach Zucchini and Suzie Sweet Pea appear to wield the kind of influence many moms and dads only wish they had.

Marketing vegetables in school lunchrooms using the Super Sprowtz - a team of fun-loving characters with super powers - as much as tripled the percentage of elementary school students choosing items from the salad bar, found researchers led by Andrew Hanks of The Ohio State University.

""If we put the time and good resources into marketing healthy choices to kids, it can work,"" said Hanks, an assistant professor of human sciences, whose study appears in the journal Pediatrics.

""These interventions don't need to be costly and there is a great opportunity to improve nutrition, performance in school and behavior as well,"" Hanks said, referring to previous studies that have linked healthful diets to success in the classroom.

Marketing to children is controversial in some circles, but Hanks said this study illuminates its potential if done well and with the best interest of kids in mind.

""Marketing can have both positive and negative effects,"" Hanks said. ""But instead of avoiding it completely, we can harness the power of marketing to help us.""

Hanks and his collaborators conducted the study while he was at Cornell University in New York. They tested three interventions in 10 public elementary schools in urban New York State.

In some, they wrapped the bottom portion of the salad bar with a vinyl banner depicting the super veggies. In others, they played Super Sprowtz videos in the lunch room. And in others, they tried both tactics.

In schools with the salad bar banners, the researchers saw 24 percent of kids taking vegetables from the salad bars, almost double what they'd observed in the weeks leading up to the change. In those schools that had characters on the salad bar and on video, veggie selection jumped from 10 percent to almost 35 percent. The researchers saw no significant improvement in schools with videos alone.

Though previous research has shown that boys are less likely than girls to choose healthier options, the results were robust in both groups.

Hanks said it's hard to say how the study would play out in suburban or rural districts. ""And it's unlikely such a technique would work with older students,"" he said.

""It's important to be strategic. If you use these characters in a middle or high school I doubt they will have much of an impact,"" said Hanks, who is also a member of Ohio State's Food Innovation Center.

""For anyone thinking 'Will this work?' our study is best generalized to an urban elementary school setting,"" he said. ""Also, the district was not extremely poor.""

Hanks noted that not many U.S. schools have salad bars, something he found surprising given the recent federal push for healthier options in the schools. ""Salad bars could be met with more enthusiasm than a spoonful of cooked carrots on a lunch tray,"" he said.

""If we can encourage kids to take vegetables of their own accord, rather than have someone put it there for them, they're much more likely to eat them,"" Hanks said.

The research was supported by the Cornell Food and Brand Lab, the Cornell Center for Behavioral Economics in Child Nutrition Programs and Founder's Farm.

Antidepressants lower the risk of suicide attempt in adults with  depression , according to a study published in the July issue of the  American Journal of Psychiatry . The researchers also found that the lower risk held true for young adults ages 18 to 25.    


""The risk of suicide attempt among depressed patients treated with SSRI drugs was about one-third that of patients who were not treated with an SSRI,"" said the lead author Robert Gibbons, director of the Center for Health Statistics and professor of biostatistics and psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ""We would not expect a lower risk in this patient population because patients treated with SSRIs are generally more severely depressed and would have a higher risk of suicide attempt.""   

The researchers analyzed medical data of 226,866 patients newly diagnosed with depression in 2003 or 2004 at the Veterans Administration healthcare system. They compared risk of suicide in four age groups (ages 18 to 25; 26 to 45; 46 to 65; and older than 65) before and after treatment with selective  serotonin  reuptake inhibitor medications, also known as SSRI drugs.   

All age groups of depressed patients who received selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors -- the most commonly prescribed  antidepressant  medication -- showed a significantly lower risk of suicide attempt when compared to those who did not receive antidepressant treatment.   

Among 82,828 patients, there were 183 suicide attempts before treatment with SSRI drugs and 102 suicide attempts after treatment with SSRI drugs (a rate that fell from 221 to 123 per 100,000 after treatment).   

In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning suggesting that SSRI drugs increase the risk of suicidal behavior in children and adolescents. An FDA advisory committee recently recommended extending this black box warning to young adults.   

Gibbons cautions that extending this warning to young adults may further decrease antidepressant treatment of depression and contribute to higher rates of suicide.   

In previous research, Gibbons reported an inverse relationship between antidepressant prescriptions and the rates of suicide in children and adolescents.

A lifetime history of  depression  is associated with increased plaques and tangles in the brains of those with  Alzheimer's disease  and more rapid cognitive decline, according to a study by researchers at the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The study is published in the February issue of Archives of General Psychiatry, one of the JAMA/Archives journals.
   
Previous studies have linked depression and Alzheimer's disease, according to background information in the article. People with a lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD) may be more likely to be diagnosed with AD. In addition, both AD and MDD are likely to affect the brain's memory-related temporal lobes. MDD is likely to caused atrophy of the hippocampus, the area where the largest amounts of plaques and tangles form in patients with AD, the authors write.
   
To assess how MDD might affect the development of AD, Michael A. Rapp, MD, PhD and colleagues at the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Mount Sinai School of Medicine compared the brains of 44 AD patients with a history of depression to those of 51 without. The group included 32 men and 63 women with an average age at death of 81 years.
   
Patients with a history of depression had more tangles and plaques in the hippocampus than those without, the authors report. People who were depressed at the time they were diagnosed with AD had even more pronounced changes in their brains than those whose depression occurred earlier or later. Based on analyses of cognitive tests given during participants' lifetimes, patients with AD who had a history of depression also experienced a more rapid decline into  dementia  than those who did not have depression.
   
""These results have great clinical significance in that the identification of potential mechanisms that link geriatric MDD as a treatable risk factor to neuropathological changes in AD may lead to the development of differential intervention and prevention strategies for AD,"" the authors conclude. ""Such specific interventions would be especially needed since geriatric patients with MDD with cognitive impairment may have less favorable treatment outcomes.""

Can your smart watch detect when you are becoming sick? A new study from Stanford, publishing in PLOS Biology, indicates that this is possible. 

By following 60 people through their everyday lives, Stanford researchers found that smart watches and other personal biosensor devices can help flag when people have colds and even signal the onset of complex conditions like Lyme disease and diabetes. ""We want to tell when people are healthy and also catch illnesses at their earliest stages,"" said Michael Snyder, PhD, Professor and Chair of Genetics at Stanford and senior author of the study. Postdoctoral scholars Xiao Li, PhD, and Jessilyn Dunn, PhD, and researcher Denis Salins share lead authorship.

Smart watches and similar portable devices are commonly used for measuring steps and physiological parameters, but have not generally been used to detect illness. Snyder's team took advantage of the portability and ease of using wearable devices to collect a myriad of measurements from participants for up to two years to detect deviations from their normal baseline for measurements such as heart rate and skin temperature. Because the devices continuously follow these measures, they potentially provide rapid means to detect the onset of diseases that change your physiology.

Many of these deviations coincided with times when people became ill. Heart rate and skin temperature tends to rise when people become ill, said Snyder.  His team wrote a software program for data from a smart watch called 'Change of Heart' to detect these deviations and sense when people are becoming sick. The devices were able to detect common colds and in one case helped detect Lyme disease - in Snyder, who participated in the study.

""I had elevated heart rate and decreased oxygen at the start of my vacation and knew something was not quite right,"" said Snyder.  After running a low-grade fever for several days, Snyder visited a physician who confirmed the illness. Snyder took the antibiotic doxycycline and the symptoms disappeared. Subsequent tests confirmed the presence of Lyme. The smart watch and an oxygen sensor were useful in detecting the earliest signs of illness.

This research paves the way for the smart phone to serve as a health dashboard, monitoring health and sensing early signs of illness, likely even before the person wearing it does.

In addition to detecting illness, the study had several other interesting findings. Individuals with indications of insulin resistance and who are therefore are at high risk for Type 2 diabetes are often unaware that they have this risk factor. Personal biosensors could potentially be developed into a simple test for those at risk for Type 2 diabetes by detecting variations in heart rate patterns, which tend to differ from those not at risk.

Another interesting finding of the study is an effect that impacts many of us. The authors found that blood oxygenation decreases during airplane flights. Although this is a known effect, the authors were able to characterize it in greater detail than has been previously reported. Snyder's team found that reduced blood oxygenation typically occurs for a large fraction of a flight and further demonstrated that this is associated with fatigue. ""Many of us have had the experience of feeling tired on airplane flights,"" Snyder said. ""Sometimes people may attribute this to staying up late, a hectic work schedule, or the stress of travel. However, it is likely that cabin pressure and reduced oxygen also are contributors."" 

""The information collected could aid your physician, although we can expect some initial challenges in how to integrate the data into clinical practice,"" said Snyder. For example, patients may want to protect the privacy of their physiologic data or may want to share only some of it.

""Physicians and third-party payers will demand robust research to help guide how this comprehensive longitudinal personal data should be used in clinical care,"" Snyder said. ""However, in the long-term I am very optimistic that personal biosensors will help us maintain healthier lives.""

The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare recently raised the recommended target blood pressure for patients with diabetes. This may lead to more patients suffering from stroke or heart attack, according to a new study from the Sahlgrenska Academy. The new study is the world's largest on the subject and is based on data from the National Diabetes Register.

In February 2015, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare raised the recommended goal for systolic blood pressure (blood pressure when the heart is contracting) in their guidelines for diabetes care.

The target blood pressure was raised from the previous level of below 130 mm Hg to below 140 mm Hg. The recommended target is important for how intensive antihypertensive treatment should be in patients with diabetes.

The background for the revised recommendation was research suggesting that not only high blood pressure values, but also values below 130 mm Hg could lead to increased morbidity from cardiovascular diseases.

The researchers behind the new study are questioning this. Their study shows a linear relationship between blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. The lower the blood pressure, the fewer cases of stroke and myocardial infarction, even at the lowest levels.

""We believe that the recommendation to accept higher blood pressure in patients with diabetes is incorrect. It may lead to more cases of stroke and myocardial infarction in this patient group,"" said Staffan Björck, Associate Professor of Nephrology at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg and one of the researchers behind the study.

The new study is based on data from the National Diabetes Register, the Patient Register and the Prescribed Drug Register. It covers 187,000 patients with type 2 diabetes, who were followed for an average of 5 years.

The main difference between this study and the studies on which the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare based its recommendations is that patients who already suffered from serious diseases were not included in the new study.

""What we have seen in our study is that, if we exclude individuals with previous severe disease, then the connection between low blood pressure and increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction disappears,"" said Samuel Adamsson Eryd, MD, the primary author of the study.

""If patients with diseases that can cause low blood pressure are also included in a study, the overall interpretation might be that low blood pressure leads to more cardiovascular disease,"" said Staffan Björck.

300,000 patients in Sweden
There are approximately 300,000 patients with diabetes in Sweden, but they are not the only ones affected by the revised blood pressure targets. Both European and American expert organizations have raised the recommended goal for systolic blood pressure to below 140 mm Hg. As the new study is much larger than all previous studies on the topic, it is important for discussions of blood pressure targets, both in Sweden and abroad.

The study Blood pressure and complications in individuals with type 2 diabetes and no previous cardiovascular disease: national population based cohort study was published in BMJ.

Elderly  cancer  survivors reported a higher number of functional limitations than women who had never been diagnosed with cancer, according to a study in the April issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. The findings suggest a need for health interventions that will enable elderly cancer survivors to regain or maintain physical function.
   
Women today have longer life expectancies than previous generations, and the population of elderly people in the United States is growing. Elderly men and women\'s ability to perform physical daily activities, such as doing housework, climbing stairs, or preparing meals, is an indicator of their overall health and well-being.
   
Carol Sweeney, Ph.D., of the University of Utah and colleagues studied data from 25,719 women of a median age of 72 years in the Iowa Women\'s Health Study (IWHS) cohort. These women completed a questionnaire in 1997 about their physical ability to perform daily functions. Examples of questions used included, \""Can you walk half a mile?\"" and \""Can you prepare most of your own meals?\""
   
Sweeney and colleagues found that five-year survivors more frequently reported functional limitations than women who had never had cancer, including inability to do heavy household work (43% vs. 31%), inability to walk a half mile (26% vs. 19%), and inability to walk up and down stairs (9% vs. 6%). Data indicates that the experience of having cancer continues to affect women\'s lives long after successful treatment, they suggest.
   
The authors write, \""These findings support the need for interventions to prevent and reverse functional decline among elderly long-term cancer survivors.\""
   
In an accompanying editorial, Julia H. Rowland, Ph.D., of the National Cancer Institute, and Rosemary Yancik, Ph.D., of the National Institute on Aging, highlight the importance of the study by Sweeney et al. They write that \""new knowledge must be generated at the cancer/aging interface and applied for optimal results for our aging and older cancer survivors. We have an urgent need to educate a generation of health care professionals equipped to research, develop, and deliver interventions to prevent or ameliorate the long-term and late effects of cancer survivorship.\""

According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), more than 2 in 3 adults are considered to be overweight or obese. 

One in 20 adults have extreme obesity, the NIDDK report, and one third of adolescents are either overweight or obese.

Overweight and obesity are considered risk factors for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, fatty liver disease, as well as several types of cancer.  

A new study looked at what effects eating dinner, or skipping it altogether, might have on body fat. The study examined the impact of early time restricted feeding (eTRF) schedules on overweight adults.

eTRF is an eating schedule that involves eating in a short period of time, usually less than 9 hours, followed by a period of fasting of 15 hours or more. 

Previous studies tested eTRF on rodents. The studies revealed that a restricted feeding schedule counters weight gain and increases energy expenditure. 

Studies in rodents showed that eTRF also decreases fat mass, as well as lowering the risk of chronic diseases. 

A recent study on mice found that time-restricted feeding (TRF), where food access was limited to 9-12 hours, is an effective intervention against obesity. 

Without any calorie restriction, a TRF pattern can work against high-fat, high-fructose, and high-sucrose diets. 

TRF also had a positive therapeutic effect against several metabolic diseases. It stabilized and finally reversed the progression of metabolic diseases in mice with pre-existing obesity and type 2 diabetes. 

The effect eTRF has on the energy metabolism is connected with the body's circadian rhythm. The metabolism works at its best in the morning, so eating more in the morning can have positive effects on one's health.   
Courtney Peterson, Ph.D,  from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and colleagues thought of examining the effects eTRF has on humans. This is the first time such an eTRF study was performed. 

The study looked at the connection between eTRF and energy expenditure, macronutrient oxidation, and appetite. For good weight management, the energy intake has to match energy expenditure. In addition, the intake of macronutrients must match macronutrients oxidation. 

Macronutrients are nutrients that the body needs to consume in large amounts in order to stay healthy. Macronutrients include carbohydrates, protein, and fats. 

The study recruited 11 overweight adults with no chronic illnesses, aged between 20-45. For a week, participants kept a regular sleep pattern. Half of the participants kept an 8 a.m.-8 p.m. eating schedule, whereas the other half ate between 8 a.m. - 2 p.m. and then did not eat anything until 8 a.m. the next day.   
In the interest of objectivity, participants tried both eating schedules and consumed the same number of calories on both eating schedules.  

On the last day of the trial, participants ate three identical meals while undergoing 24-hour metabolic testing. Their appetite was also measured with the help of a visual analog scale.   

The study did not find any connection between eTRF and energy expenditure. Participants who were under an eTRF schedule did not burn more calories.

However, researchers found higher levels of fat oxidations at night during eTRF, along with increased protein oxidation. They also noticed a decrease in hunger swings during the day, as well as positive changes in energy metabolism. Therefore, eTRF may positively impact body composition.

It also improved metabolic flexibility, which is the body's ability to switch between burning carbs and fats.

""These preliminary findings suggest for the first time in humans what we've seen in animal models - that the timing of eating during the day does have an impact on our metabolism,"" says Prof. Dale Schoeller, a spokesperson for The Obesity Society.

The study - presented at The Obesity Society Annual Meeting at ObesityWeek 2016 in New Orleans, LA - indicates that eTRF might help with weight loss.
""Eating only during a much smaller window of time than people are typically used to may help with weight loss,"" says Peterson, who led the study.""We found that eating between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. followed by an 18-hour daily fast kept appetite levels more even throughout the day, in comparison to eating between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., which is what the median American does.""
Courtney Peterson
Diminished daily hunger swings and higher metabolic flexibility, which were noticed in the study, might help with losing weight. However, researchers point out that this preliminary study is not enough to determine whether eTRF actually helps adults lose weight.  

""With additional research on early-time restricted feeding on humans, we can create a more complete picture of whether this innovative method can best help prevent and treat obesity,"" says
Prof. Schoeller.

People age 70 and older who continued taking the  antidepressant  that helped them to initially recover from their first episode of  depression  were 60 percent less likely to experience a new episode of depression over a two-year study period than those who stopped taking the medication, according to a study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), part of the National Institutes of Health. The study addresses a major question in the treatment of depression – when to discontinue medication.
   
Published in the March, 2006 New England Journal of Medicine, the study showed that long-term treatment (for at least 2 years) after a patient is symptom-free is effective in preventing future depressive episodes.
   
""This study demonstrates the benefits of keeping older patients on an antidepressant long after they become symptom-free,"" said NIMH's director Thomas R. Insel, M.D.
   
The clinical trial tested whether maintenance therapy – long-term treatment given to patients to enable them to maintain a symptom-free or disease-free state – is effective in preventing future episodes of depression in patients 70 years and older. It also tested whether antidepressant medication and psychotherapy were effective, and whether the extent of patients' medical burden had an impact on rates of recurrence.
   
According to Charles F. Reynolds III, M.D., and colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh, the study speaks directly to the controversy over the benefits and risks of administering long-term antidepressant treatment to elderly patients who have only one lifetime occurrence of major depression. To date, the consensus has been that older patients experiencing their first episode of depression should be treated to full remission and then have a limited period of continuation treatment for 6 to 12 months to ensure the stability of the remission and further improve recovery.
   
""Most geriatric psychiatrists would not have thought that elderly 70 and older who experienced one episode of depression were candidates for longer term maintenance treatment of up to two years,"" said Reynolds. ""They would agree that elderly with two or more episodes are appropriately prescribed maintenance treatment, but these data allow us to go one step further and suggest that, in fact, even those with single episodes fare considerably better out to two years if they continue use of the medication that got them well.""
   
Patients ages 70 and older with depression who achieved full remission of symptoms after treatment using a combination of paroxetine (a selective  serotonin  reuptake inhibitor) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) (psychotherapy that focuses on interpersonal relationships) were administered maintenance treatment where researchers tested the effectiveness of different treatment regimens in keeping patients symptom-free for up to 2 years. These patients were randomly assigned to one of four maintenance treatment groups: (1) paroxetine; (2) placebo; (3) paroxetine and monthly interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT); and (4)  placebo  and IPT.
   
The study found maintenance treatment was effective in older people with depression. Across all four treatment groups, rates of remission significantly differed. Among patients who received paroxetine in the maintenance phase, 63 percent remained in remission; 42 percent of those who received placebo remained in remission; 65 percent of patients who received paroxetine and IPT remained in remission; and 32 percent of patients who received placebo and IPT remained in remission.
   
Contrary to the researchers' hypothesis, which predicted that IPT would significantly reduce rates of recurrence, according to the study, IPT did not show preventive efficacy in people 70 years and older.
   
""But that does not mean that other types of psychotherapy are not effective,"" said Reynolds. ""It could be that this population needs a more structured and focused type of psychotherapy – one that works better with cognitive impairment and greater disability than does IPT – such as problem-solving psychotherapy. Involving caregivers to a greater extent may also help.""
   
The study also showed that older people with multiple chronic physical disorders did not do as well on paroxetine as those with fewer medical problems, although they did show some benefit. The burden associated with more chronic and disabling diseases often drives the depression, making it more difficult to treat, the authors conclude. Despite this, the researchers indicate that maintenance antidepressant medication may be effective in primary care settings where patients have multiple chronic diseases
   
""What makes this study so practical is that it shows you can combine chronic disease management of depression with the chronic disease management of other illnesses to benefit both the patient's mental illness as well as their physical illness,"" he said.
   
The study is part of an overall NIMH effort to conduct practical clinical trials in ""real world"" settings that address public health issues important to persons affected by major mental illnesses.

Births among Hispanic and black teens have dropped by almost half since 2006, according to a new analysis published by CDC. This mirrors a substantial national decline: births to all American teenagers have dropped more than 40 percent within the past decade. Despite this progress, key challenges persist for many communities, according to the report.
 
While dramatic declines among Hispanic and black teens (51 percent and 44 percent, respectively) have helped reduce gaps, birth rates remain twice as high for these teens nationally compared with white teens. Published in CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the new analysis highlights key community- and state-level patterns:
 

""The United States has made remarkable progress in reducing both teen pregnancy and racial and ethnic differences, but the reality is, too many American teens are still having babies,"" said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. ""By better understanding the many factors that contribute to teen pregnancy we can better design, implement, evaluate, and improve prevention interventions and further reduce disparities.""

In the new report, CDC researchers analyzed national- and state-level data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) to examine trends in births to American teens ages 15 to 19 years between 2006 and 2014. County-level NVSS data for 2013 and 2014 also offer a point-in-time picture of local birth rates. To better understand the relationship between key social and economic factors and teen birth rates, researchers examined data from the American Community Survey between 2010 and 2014. 

Researchers highlight the importance of teen pregnancy prevention interventions that address socioeconomic conditions like unemployment and lower education levels, for reducing disparities in teen birth rates. State and community leaders can use local data to better understand teen pregnancy in their communities and to direct programs and resources to areas with the greatest need.

""These data underscore that the solution to our nation's teen pregnancy problem is not going to be a one-size-fits-all - teen birth rates vary greatly across state lines and even within states,"" said Lisa Romero, Dr.PH., a health scientist in CDC's Division of Reproductive Health and lead author of the analysis. ""We can ensure the success of teen pregnancy prevention efforts by capitalizing on the expertise of our state and local public health colleagues. Together, we can work to implement proven prevention programs that take into account unique, local needs.""

Research has shown that teen pregnancy and childbirth cost U.S. taxpayers an estimated $9 billion each year and have negative health and social consequences. 

Preventing teen pregnancy remains one of CDC's top priorities and the agency is working on a number of fronts. One key component of this work is encouraging community-centered efforts. For example, between 2010 and 2015, CDC and the HHS Office of Adolescent Health (OAH) collaborated to demonstrate the effectiveness of innovative, multicomponent, communitywide initiatives in reducing rates of teen pregnancy and births in communities with the highest rates, with a focus on reaching African American and Latino or Hispanic young people ages 15 to 19 years. Preliminary outcome data indicate that the community-wide initiatives were successful - each community increased the number of teens who received evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention interventions and reproductive health services, as well as the percentage of teens who received moderately or highly effective contraceptive methods, including long-acting reversible contraception. Many of those strategies are now being implemented across the U.S. through 84 new five-year teen pregnancy prevention grants supported by OAH.

Australia could save AUD $3.4 billion (USD $2.3 billion) in healthcare costs over the remaining lifetimes of all Australians alive in 2010 by instituting a combination of taxes on unhealthy foods and subsidies on fruits and vegetables, according to a new study published in PLOS Medicine by Linda Cobiac, from the University of Melbourne, Australia and colleagues.
 
An increasing number of Western countries have implemented or proposed taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks in an attempt to curb rates of dietary-related diseases, however the cost-effectiveness of combining various taxes and subsidies is not well-understood. In the new study, researchers modeled the effect of taxes on saturated fat, salt, sugar, and sugar-sweetened beverages and a subsidy on fruits and vegetables on the Australian population of 22 million alive in 2010. They simulated how different combinations of these taxes and subsidies - designed so there would be less than a one percent change in total food expenditure for the average household - impacted the death and morbidity rates of Australians as well as healthcare spending over the remainder of their lives.
  
The greatest impact, the researchers concluded, came from a sugar tax, which could avert 270,000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs, or years of healthy lifespan across the population lost due to disease). ""That is a gain of 1.2 years of healthy life for every 100 Australians alive in 2010,"" the authors say.  ""Few other public health interventions could deliver such health gains on average across the whole population."" 
  
A salt tax was estimated to save 130,000 DALYS over the remainder of the lives of Australians alive in 2010, a saturated fat tax 97,000 DALYs, and a sugar-sweetened beverage tax 12,000 DALYs. Combined with taxes, the fruit and vegetable subsidies made for additional averted DALYs and reduced health sector spending, but on their own were not estimated to lead to a clear health benefit. Overall, when combined to maximize benefits, the taxes and subsidies could save an estimated 470,000 DALYs and reduce spending by AUD $3.4 billion (USD $2.3 billion).
  
""Simulation studies, such as ours, have uncertainty.  For example, we are reliant on other research estimating the responsiveness of the public to changes in food prices. There are also implementation issues for the food industry."" 
  
""Nevertheless, this study adds to the growing evidence of large health benefits and cost-effectiveness of using taxes and regulatory measures to influence the consumption of healthy foods,"" the authors say. ""We believe that with such large potential health benefits for the Australian population and large benefits in reducing health sector spending...the formulation of a tax and subsidy package should be given more prominent and serious consideration in public health nutrition strategy.""
  
""Several countries have imposed taxes on sugary drinks, with the UK the latest to consider such a policy.  Our research suggests that even bigger health gains and cost savings may be possible with food taxes and subsidies on a wider range of foods.""

Men with  prostate cancer  make emotionally driven treatment decisions influenced by anecdote and misconception rather than consideration of clinical trial evidence, according to a new study. Published in the August 1, 2006 issue of  CANCER  ( http://www.interscience.wiley.com/cancer-newsroom ), a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society, the study reveals that fear and uncertainty drove initial treatment decisions seeking rapid results, and that there was little interest in seeking second opinions. Furthermore, patient decisions were influenced by misconceptions about disease management options, and men often erroneously applied the anecdotal experiences of others with prostate cancer to their own circumstances, even when the severity of their own disease and available treatment options were significantly different.
   
While there are several treatment options for men with localized prostate cancer, clinical trials have failed to demonstrate one optimal therapy. Each treatment option has benefits and its own unique and significant adverse side effects. Radical prostatectomy, for example, has only minimal survival benefits compared to even observation, but is associated with complications, such as  impotence  and  urinary incontinence . With no clear-cut medical guidance, patients must assume a greater role in deciding on treatment in the face of disquieting statistics and risk-benefit information.
   
To characterize the factors that influence men\'s treatment decisions, Thomas Denberg, M.D., Ph.D. of the University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center and colleagues interviewed 20 men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer before and after treatment.
   
Three factors characterized the patients\' decisions: fear and uncertainty; misconceptions about treatment efficacy and risks; and anecdotal information about other\'s experiences with prostate cancer. Even though most patients knew prostate cancer grows slowly, such \""abstract knowledge did little to dispel the vividly frightening, yet unlikely prospect of prostate cancer suddenly \'blossoming,\'\"" the researchers write.
   
After urologists reviewed the risks and benefits of the treatment options, patients had poor recall of the information they were provided, often confused side effects and treatments, and often said that the side effects had no impact on their treatment decision. Sixteen of 20 men did not intend to seek a second opinion, generally because of misconceptions about its purpose.
   
Dr. Denberg and his colleagues report that \""this study illustrates that while attention to health information, outcome preferences, and the framing of numerical risk is necessary, it is hardly sufficient for achieving quality in patient-centered decision-making.\"" It is important to give greater attention to patients\' fears, misconceptions, and anecdotal influences.

125,273084,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315198.php,"No silver bullet to beating obesity, study finds",Obesity / Weight Loss / Fitness,Obesity / Weight Loss / Fitness,Nutrition / Diet,,,1,1,4,3,3,5,3,4,2,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,"
As many seek to battle festive bulge in January, new research challenges previous findings that any single aspect of diet or lifestyle can be targeted to reduce the risk of obesity in adults with a high genetic risk of putting on weight.

The study, led by the University of Exeter Medical School, finds instead that many fattening aspects of the environment, lifestyle and behaviour interact with a person's genes to influence his or her waistline - and that the strongest influence is from poverty.

The findings contradict some studies, which have concluded that concentrating obesity policy on specific aspects such as the consumption of fizzy drinks or fried food could make a meaningful difference to help decrease waistlines, especially in those of us at high genetic risk of obesity. The new research challenges this, and concludes that it is premature to suggest that specific aspects of behaviour or the environment can be targeted to reduce obesity levels effectively in people at high risk due to their genes.

Dr Jessica Tyrrell, who led the research, said: ""Our findings suggest that it is premature to target any particular aspect of the environment or behaviour to try to reduce obesity. There is no 'silver bullet' to reducing obesity risk. It is misleading to suggest public health measures should be targeted specifically at fried food reduction, fizzy drink consumption or TV watching in those genetically predisposed to obesity, as some previous studies in leading medical journals have suggested. Instead, the data are consistent with proposals that public health measures should aim to alter all aspects of these fattening factors in small ways to have more impact in lowering levels of obesity and type 2 diabetes.""

A person's genes can mean they are more susceptible to becoming obese or developing type 2 diabetes in today's modern world of plentiful food and sedentary lifestyles. However, until now, little has been known about how genes interact with the modern environment and human behaviour to mean some people with this predisposition become obese, while others remain slim.

The study, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, used 120,000 individuals from the UK Biobank, and could influence future policy on reducing obesity, one of today's greatest global health challenges. In the UK, obesity affects around one in every four adults and one in every five children aged 10-11, according to the NHS. Being obese increases risk of developing type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some cancers and stroke.

The study concludes that poverty is likely to be related to many different factors, reflecting socioeconomic influences on diet and activity levels. Previous studies have shown that in high income countries people from more deprived social backgrounds are more likely to be obese, but this study provides the strongest evidence yet that these effects are even stronger in people at the highest genetic risk of obesity. This type of study was not possible until recently, when large numbers of genetic variants altering BMI, a measure of weight, were discovered.

The team found the first robust evidence that people experiencing less favourable socioeconomic circumstances and at high genetic risk were overweight to a greater extent than would be expected by simply adding up the two risk factors. The differences do not push people from normal weight to obesity but add a few kilograms of weight - enough to make an important additional contribution to the strain placed on healthcare systems.

The authors found that, within the poorest half of the population, carrying 10 additional genetic risk factors for obesity was associated with approximately 3.8kg extra weight in someone 1.73m tall. In contrast, being of the same height and carrying the same number of obesity risk genetic factors was associated with just 2.9kg extra weight in the richest half of the population.

Professor Tim Frayling, of the University of Exeter Medical School, oversaw the study. He said: ""In order to inform evidence-based policy decisions around obesity, we need to understand more about the complex mix of genes, environment, behaviour and lifestyle. Our study suggests that genes and environment can interact to provide a ""double whammy"" type effect, but, critically, it is really hard to narrow down which parts of the environment and lifestyle are the most critical. Large genetic datasets from resources like the UK Biobank are helping us pick the problem apart.""

New research from New Zealand's University of Otago suggests that people managing type 2 diabetes should walk after meals to gain the greatest blood sugar-lowering benefits.

Current advice in New Zealand is for people with type 2 diabetes to walk at least 30 minutes a day. No particular time of the day is advised. The Otago research indicates that walking after meals is better at reducing blood sugar levels than taking a single 30 minute walk at any time of the day.

The researchers prescribed walking to 41 patients with type 2 diabetes in two-week blocks, separated by a month. The patients - who were fitted with accelerometers to measure their physical activity and devices that measured their blood sugar every five minutes - were to walk either for thirty minutes a day as advised by guidelines, or to walk for 10 minutes after each main meal.

Study first author Dr Andrew Reynolds says the study found that post-meal blood sugar levels dropped 12 per cent on average when the participants followed the walking after meals advice compared to walking at any time of the day.

""Most of this effect came from the highly significant 22 per cent reduction in blood sugar when walking after evening meals, which were the most carbohydrate heavy, and were followed by the most sedentary time,"" Dr Reynolds says.

Corresponding author Professor Jim Mann says that post-meal glucose is regarded as an important target in managing type 2 diabetes, given its independent contribution to overall blood sugar control and cardiovascular risk.

Professor Mann and his colleagues (Dr Reynolds, Dr Bernard Venn and Associate Professor Sheila Williams) write that ""postprandial physical activity may avoid the need for an increased total insulin dose or additional mealtime insulin injections that might otherwise have been prescribed to lower glucose levels after eating. An increase in insulin dose might, in turn, be associated with weight gain in patients with type 2 diabetes, many of whom are already overweight or obese.""

They conclude that: ""The benefits relating to physical activity following meals suggest that current guidelines should be amended to specify post-meal activity, particularly when meals contain a substantial amount of carbohydrate.""

Their findings are published this week in the prestigious international journal Diabetologia. A second UK-based study in the same edition of the journal shows that increasing your amount of activity also confers greater benefit in blood sugar control.

Why do some people get Type 2 diabetes, while others who live the same lifestyle never do?

For decades, scientists have tried to solve this mystery - and have found more than 80 tiny DNA differences that seem to raise the risk of the disease in some people, or protect others from the damagingly high levels of blood sugar that are its hallmark.

But no one ""Type 2 diabetes signature"" has emerged from this search.

Now, a team of scientists has reported a discovery that might explain how multiple genetic flaws can lead to the same disease.

They've identified something that some of those diabetes-linked genetic defects have in common: they seem to change the way certain cells in the pancreas ""read"" their genes.

The discovery could eventually help lead to more personalized treatments for diabetes. But for now, it's the first demonstration that many Type 2 diabetes-linked DNA changes have to do with the same DNA-reading molecule. Called Regulatory Factor X, or RFX, it's a master regulator for a number of genes.

The team reporting the findings in a new paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences comes from the University of Michigan, National Institutes of Health, Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, University of North Carolina, and the University of Southern California.

They report that many diabetes-linked DNA changes affect the ability of RFX to bind to specific locations in the genomes of pancreas cell clusters called islets. And that in turn changes the cells' ability to carry out important functions.

Islets contain the cells that make hormones, including insulin and glucagon, which keep blood sugar balanced in healthy people. In people with diabetes, that regulation goes awry - leading to a range of health problems that can develop over many years.

""We have found that many of the subtle DNA spelling differences that increase risk of Type 2 diabetes appear to disrupt a common regulatory grammar in islet cells,"" says Stephen C.J. Parker, Ph.D., an assistant professor of computational medicine and bioinformatics, and of human genetics, at the U-M Medical School. ""RFX is probably unable to read the misspelled words, and this disruption of regulatory grammar plays a significant role in the genetic risk of Type 2 diabetes.""

Parker is one of four co-senior authors on the paper, which also includes Michael Boehnke, Ph.D., of the U-M School of Public Health's Department of Biostatistics, Francis Collins, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Institutes of Health, and Michael L. Stitzel, Ph.D. of the Jackson Laboratory.

Prior to their current faculty positions Parker and Stitzel worked in Collins' lab at the National Human Genome Research Institute. Parker's graduate student, Arushi Varshney, is one of the paper's co-first authors with Laura Scott, Ph.D., and Ryan Welch, Ph.D., of the U-M School of Public Health's Department of Biostatistics and Michael Erdos, Ph.D., of the National Human Genome Research Institute.

They performed an extensive examination of DNA from islet samples isolated from 112 people. They characterized differences not just in DNA sequences, but also in the way DNA was packaged and modified by epigenetic factors, and the levels of gene expression products that indicated how often the genes had been read and transcribed.

This allowed them to track the ""footprints"" that RFX and other transcription factors leave on packaged DNA after they have done their job.

RFX and other factors don't bind directly to the part of a gene that encodes a protein that does a cellular job. Rather, they bind to a stretch of DNA near the gene - a runway of sorts.

But when genetic changes linked to Type 2 diabetes are present, that runway gets disrupted, and RFX can't bind as it should.

Each DNA change might alter this binding in a different way, leading to a slightly different effect on Type 2 diabetes risk or blood sugar regulation. But the common factor for many of these changes was its effect on the area where RFX is predicted to bind, in the cells of pancreatic islets.

So, says Parker, this shows how the genome - the actual sequence of DNA - can influence the epigenome, or the factors that influence gene expression.

The researchers note that a deadly form of diabetes seen in a handful of babies born each year may be related to RFX mutations. That condition, called Mitchell-Riley syndrome, involves neonatal diabetes and malformed pancreas, and is known to be caused by a rare autosomal recessive mutation of one form of RFX.

A new study from Keith Baar's Functional Molecular Biology Laboratory at the UC Davis College of Biological Sciences and the Australian Institute of Sport suggests that consuming a gelatin supplement, plus a burst of intensive exercise, can help build ligaments, tendons and bones. The study is published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

Connective tissue and bone injuries are common in both athletes and the elderly, and interfere with peoples' ability (and enthusiasm) for exercise, whether they are an elite athlete or just trying to lose weight and maintain fitness and flexibility. Steps that can prevent injury and enhance recovery are therefore of great interest.

Obviously, it's difficult to assess the direct effect of a supplement on tissues without opening up someone's knee. But Baar's laboratory has been developing techniques to grow artificial ligaments in the laboratory. They used their lab-dish ligaments as a stand-in for the real thing.

Baar, Greg Shaw at the Australian Institute of Sport, and colleagues enrolled eight health young men in a trial of a gelatin supplement enhanced with vitamin C. The volunteers drank the supplement and had blood taken, and after one hour performed a short (five minute) bout of high-impact exercise (skipping).

The researchers tested the blood for amino acids that could build up the collagen protein that composes tendons, ligaments, and bones. They also tested blood samples for their effect on Baar's lab-grown ligaments at UC Davis.

The gelatin supplement increased blood levels of amino acids and markers linked to collagen synthesis, and improved the mechanics of the engineered lab-grown ligaments, they found.

""These data suggest that adding gelatin and vitamin C to an intermittent exercise program could play a beneficial role in injury prevention and tissue repair,"" the researchers wrote.

Neighborhood features including street lighting, parks, public transportation and maintained vacant lots were associated with lower odds of homicide among young people ages 13 to 20, according to an article published online by JAMA Pediatrics.

Youth violence is as complex as it is pervasive. Understanding the influence of modifiable environmental factors on adolescent homicide is an important step in designing interventions for youth violence prevention.
 
Alison J. Culyba, M.D., M.P.H., of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and coauthors looked at the association between neighborhood environmental features and adolescent homicide in Philadelphia. The study included 143 homicide victims (average age 18.4 years) and 155 matched control participants who were not victims of homicide.
 
Researchers used pictures to create 360-degree panoramic images of the neighborhood from the street corner closest to each homicide and the location of control participants at the time of the homicides for comparison. The photographs were coded for 60 environmental elements.
 
Study results indicate lower odds of adolescent homicide were associated with street lighting, illuminated walk/don't walk signs, painted marked crosswalks, public transportation, parks and maintained vacant lots.
 
The odds of adolescent homicide were higher in places with stop signs, houses with security bars/gratings and private bushes or plantings.
 
The authors note their study has limitations such as unmeasured individual, social and contextual factors that were not included but may have influenced the findings.
 
""The findings related to maintained vacant lots and green space hold promise as targets for future place-based interventions. Researchers using this urban revitalization strategy should consider studying homicide reduction as a key health outcome. ... We identified multiple modifiable factors that can potentially be targeted in future randomized intervention trials to investigate ways to reduce youth violence by improving neighborhood context,"" the study concludes.",0

According to a survey young women who suffered from  anorexia  run a lower risk of getting  breast cancer . Experts are now wondering whether there is a link between calorie intake in early life and the development of  cancer .    
The experts have also warned that girls should not become anorexic because of this news.  Anorexia is a serious mental disorder with life-threatening complications.    
The findings of this study could help scientists understand how breast cancer develops.    
Young women who had been in hospital because of anorexia were 50% less likely to develop breast cancer than women who had never suffered from anorexia.    
The next step is to try to figure out what the real mechanisms may be...to explain the connection,"" said co-author Karin Michels, associate professor at Harvard Medical School who did the research with Dr. Anders Ekbom of Karolinska Institute, Stockholm.    
You can read about this study in this weeks edition of JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association).    
Experts have known for a long time that there is a link between weight gain and breast cancer.    
Michels said calorie restriction during early adolescence might stunt breast cell reproduction and reduce the chance for mutations to occur that could lead to cancer.    
Also, calorie restriction during crucial phases of development might reduce levels of  estrogen  and other hormones that are linked to  tumor  development, Michels said. Girls with anorexia often stop menstruating, which reduces their estrogen levels.    
Reduced estrogen exposure is the most likely explanation for the results, but the study is far from proof of any link between anorexia and a reduced breast cancer risk, said Dr. Charles Loprinzi, a Mayo Clinic breast cancer specialist.    
Once the mechanisms are better understood, scientists might be able to design an intervention, including medication, 'that is more practical than just generalized starvation,' said researcher Margot Cleary of the University of Minnesota's Hormel Institute.    
The researchers examined breast cancer incidence in 7,303 Swedish women who were under 40 when they underwent hospital treatment for anorexia between 1965 and 1998. Most developed anorexia before age 20.    
Only seven women developed breast cancer by the study's end in 2000. Nearly 15 cases would have been expected in the general population, a difference of 53 percent. That translates to about one anorexic woman developing breast cancer out of 1,000, compared with two out of 1,000 in the general population. ",0

About 10 percent of infants worldwide are born prematurely and about 15 percent of them weigh less than 1,500 grams and are classified as having very low birth weight (VLBW). Sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) cause illness and death in VLBW infants. A lower incidence of NEC and sepsis is associated with VLBW infants fed their own mother's milk. However, lactation can be delayed after a premature delivery, which results in insufficient amounts of milk during those critical early days.
 
Johannes B. van Goudoever, Ph.D., of the Emma Children's Hospital - Academic Medical Center and the VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, and coauthors examined whether providing donor milk instead of formula as supplemental feeding whenever a mother's own milk was insufficiently available during the first 10 days of life would reduce the incidence of serious infection, NEC and death.
 
The randomized clinical included 373 VLBW infants born in the Netherlands and, of those, 183 received donor milk and 190 received formula. The proportion of their own mother's milk during the first 10 days of life was high in both groups (89.1 percent of the total average intake during the intervention period for the donor milk group and 84.5 percent for the formula group).
 
The incidence of the combined outcome of serious infection, NEC and death was not significantly different between the two groups (44.7 percent in the formula group vs. 42.1 percent in the donor milk group), according to the study results.
 
The authors note the intervention period of the clinical trial was short. It also has been suggested that pasteurization and other processing steps may alter the quality of donor milk.
 
""This double-blind RCT [randomized clinical trial] found no significant effect of pasteurized donor milk during the first 10 days of life for preventing serious infections, NEC and all-cause mortality in premature neonates. The results of this trial stress the importance of providing premature neonates with raw milk from their own mother,"" the study concludes.

Around one in seven 11 years olds in the UK have had at least one drink of alcohol, according to a study published in the open access journal BMC Public Health, which analyzed data from 10,498 children aged 11.

The study, by researchers from University College London and the London School of Economics and Political Science, is the first to examine drinking behaviors in very early adolescence in relation to a wide range of factors that are associated with alcohol consumption in children, such as family, friends and the young person's views about alcohol.

The researchers found that nearly 14% of 11 year olds had drunk more than a few sips of alcohol at least once. It is not possible to make statements regarding cause and effect with this sort of study, but the numbers do show a strong association between 11 year olds drinking and their friends' and mothers' behavior. Children whose mothers drank heavily were 80% more likely to drink than children whose mothers did not drink and boys were more likely to report drinking than girls. Children whose friends drank were five times more likely to drink than those whose friends did not drink. It was also found that friends' drinking had a stronger association with children's alcohol consumption than parents' drinking. Other factors associated with drinking were having started puberty, being a second or later born child, having socioemotional difficulties (e.g. sustaining positive relationships, experiencing, managing or expressing emotions) and antisocial behaviors.

Positive perceptions of alcohol were associated with increased odds of a child drinking. These include perceptions that alcohol makes people feel better about themselves or that it makes it easier to make friends. Other factors associated with increased odds of a child drinking were a lack of parental supervision on weekends and weekdays, and not being happy with family relationships.

Children were less likely to drink if they had heightened perceptions of the harms of drinking and negative expectations towards alcohol, such as that it makes it hard to get along with friends or that it impacts school work.

Lead author Yvonne Kelly, from University College London, said: ""Drinking in adolescence is considered a 'risky' behavior, it often co-occurs with other 'risky' behaviors and it is linked to educational failure and to premature mortality, for example via accidental deaths. Improving our understanding of the factors that influence drinking is important as it has implications for the development of policies and interventions aimed at reducing 'risky' behaviors.""

To assess factors that may influence drinking in this age group the researchers analyzed data from 10,498 11 year olds collected as part of the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS). The MCS is a UK-wide study of children born between September 2000 and January 2002. Data was collected from cohort members at five time points between nine months and 11 years of age. Interview data, collected during home visits, was available for 69% of families when cohort members were aged 11.

Questions 11 year olds were asked included ""Have you ever had an alcoholic drink? That is more than a few sips?"" Parents were asked how often and how much they drank. Friends' drinking was assessed by asking cohort members whether their friends drank alcohol. Further questions evaluated perceptions of risk due to alcohol, positive or negative expectations of alcohol and parental supervision and family relationships.
Data on the drinking behaviors of cohort members and their friends were self-reported and may therefore be prone to over- or under-estimation. Due to the phrasing of questions, it was impossible to distinguish children who only ever had one alcoholic drink from those who drink more regularly. Because this was an observational study, no causal relationship between children's drinking and friends' or parents' drinking, perceptions of harm or expectations towards drinking could be inferred.

The researchers suggest that while the vast majority of children at the age of eleven are yet to explore alcohol, investigating in more detail the context in which children drink - who they drink with, where, when, what they drink and how they acquire alcohol - could help inform effective policy and alcohol harm prevention strategies to mitigate the risk associated with drinking in youth.

Yvonne Kelly said: ""Our findings support the need for interventions working at multiple levels, including family and school, to help shape choices around risky behaviors including drinking.""",2

Breast  cancer  patients who do  yoga  tend to enjoy better health, less  fatigue  and experience less daytime sleepiness - this applies to women who are undergoing  radiotherapy  for their  breast cancer , say scientists from the University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, USA.    

Lorenzo Cohen, study leader, said even a short yoga program - including meditation, relaxation, breathing exercises, stretching, imagery and  physical movements - can be very useful at reducing the side effects that come with breast cancer treatment.    

The study looked at 61 women who were undergoing a six-week radiotherapy course after breast cancer surgery.  Half of them attended a twice-weekly yoga class, the other half didn't.  At the end of the courses - radiotherapy and yoga courses - they had to fill in a questionnaire.    

The questionnaire asked how well they coped with lifting shopping bags, walking a mile, how tired they felt (fatigue), how well they felt - other questions were also asked, all related to their general well being and ability to carry out certain physical functions.    

Depending on how the women answered the questionnaire, points were attributed, up to a maximum of 100.  The yoga group scored an average of 82 points while the non-yoga group scored 69.    
 What is Yoga?   
 Yoga  is a  Sanskrit  word that means  Union .  Sanskrit is an ancient language from India.  It refers to the union of the body, mind and spirit.    

There is much more to Yoga than just sitting in certain positions and stretching the body.  The physical postures and poses of yoga are called  Asana , also a Sanskrit word.  Asana is one of eight aspects, or limbs, of yoga.  Yoga has much more to do with a human's spiritual and mental well being than many people realise.    

An important part of yoga involves the creation of a balance in the body through the development of strength and flexibility.  This is achieved mainly through performing certain poses - each pose has benefits.  The poses can be done rapidly, one after the other - this creates heat in the body as a result of movement.  It is also possible to perform the movements slowly, this raises stamina - the person in this case is also improving the alignment of the pose.  Yoga experts may disagree on how each pose should be ideally performed.    

People who practise Yoga say it is never boring as one's experience with yoga develops over time.    

Yoga is for everyone, say people who practise it.  You do not need to have a flexible body to start.  Yoga is  entirely non-competitive - each person just does his/her best.    

Yoga is open to people of both sexes, all ages, any level of fitness, and people of any weight.    
 Yoga classes can include:   
-- Physical movements including poses and postures  
-- Instruction on breathing  
-- Call and response chanting  
-- Meditation  
-- Inspiration reading   

Whether the emphasis may be more on physical movements, meditation or one of the other factors will depend on the teacher's background.

Treating major  depression  can be quite a puzzle, and a newly published UCLA study suggests medication is just one of many potential pieces.
   
Published in the August 2006 edition of the American Journal of Psychiatry, the study used electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements to demonstrate an association between eventual clinical outcome and regional changes in brain activity during a  placebo  lead-in phase prior to  antidepressant  treatment.
   
The findings suggest that factors such as patient beliefs and expectations, doctor-patient relationships, or treatment history help complete the treatment picture.
   
In this study, all subjects received blinded treatment with placebo for one week prior to receiving antidepressant medication. A ""placebo lead-in"" phase is commonly used to familiarize patients with study procedures and to minimize the effect of any pre-existing treatment for depression. The placebo lead-in includes patient care, participation and treatment with placebo; the clinical impact is largely unknown.
   
This study is the first to assess the relationship between brain changes during the placebo lead-in phase and later clinical outcome of antidepressant treatment.
   
""Treatment results appear to be predicted, in part, by changes in brain activity found during placebo lead-in--prior to the actual use of antidepressant medication,"" said lead author Aimee M. Hunter, a research associate at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA. ""More research is needed to identify the impact of other non-drug factors that affect brain activity and clinical improvement in patients receiving antidepressant treatment."" Semel Institute researchers examined data from 51 adults with major depression who were involved in two independent, double-blind placebo-controlled trials.
   
Quantitative EEG cordance measures were taken at baseline and at the end of the placebo lead-in period. Cordance is a quantitative EEG (QEEG) imaging technique developed at UCLA to measure brain function. Measurements are performed by placing recording electrodes on the scalp. The electrodes connect to the body through conductive paste or gel. It does not hurt and involves no radioactivity. The electrodes are connected to a computer, which measures the signals coming from the brain and processes them into colorful patterns.
   
Relationships between regional cordance changes at the end of the placebo lead-in period and clinical outcome were examined using a statistical tool called multiple linear regression analysis. Final outcomes were determined using Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores.
   
The study found that decreases in cordance in the prefrontal brain region during the placebo lead-in period were associated with lower depression-scale scores after eight weeks of antidepressant treatment. In subjects randomly assigned to medication, prefrontal changes during placebo lead-in explained 19 percent of the variance in final depression scores.

There is a type of  cancer , called CTVT (canine transmissible venereal  tumor ) which is transmitted mainly through sexual contacts, but may also be passed on as a dog bites, sniffs or licks the tumor-affected areas, say scientists and vets from University College London (UCL).  The cancer is rarely fatal and goes away after three to nine months - however, it is present in the dog long enough for it to pass it on to other dogs.    

The researchers say humans do not have to worry as this type of cancer cannot be passed on from dog to people, it only occurs in dogs.  It is a type of cancer that can spread from dog-to-dog as if it were an infection.    

Professor Robin Weiss, UCL Division of Infection and Immunity, team leader, said  “It appears that man's best friend can be its own worst enemy.  Our study shows that CTVT has become a parasite that has long outlived its original host.  Our discovery is of much broader significance than simply a disease in dogs.”    
 “Firstly ,  CTVT represents the longest-lived cancer 'clone' known to science.  It contradicts the current view that cancer cells generate more and more mutations and inevitably become more aggressive if untreated.”    
 ""Secondly ,  recent research in Australia has revealed the existence of a newly emerged tumour in Tasmanian Devils that also appears to be caused by transmissible cancer cells, in this case by biting.  Devils are an endangered marsupial species and there are fears that the new tumour might finally kill them off altogether.  The methods used at UCL for dogs could help to determine whether the Devil tumour is also a 'parasitic' cancer.”    
 ""Thirdly ,  our findings also show that cancer cells can evade immune responses and CTVT is particularly smart in this regard.  On rare occasions cancer cells have been transmitted from one human to another by hiding in organ transplants.  Because the recipient is treated with immunosuppressants in order to prevent rejection, the transferred cancer cells can then grow into tumours just like CTVT.  That is why people who have suffered from cancer should not become organ donors.""    

CTVT was first isolated in 16 dogs in Kenya, India and Italy.  Genetic studies showed that in each case the tumor had been passed on by another canine.  Further studies on 40 more dogs  from around the world indicated that the cancer originated from a single source that has managed to spread worldwide.    

After liasing with geneticists and computer experts in Chicago, USA, the scientists believe the cancer appeared between 250 to 1000 years ago - probably in a wolf, Husky or a Shih Tzu.    

Unlike most cancers, which with time become more aggressive and genetically more unstable, CTVT is genetically stable and has been around for a very long time.  This could change the way scientists view the stability of cancer, allowing for the possibility that as a tumor gets worse it does not necessarily become genetically more unstable.

Scientists have unexpectedly discovered that mice with the gene defect that causes  colon cancer  in humans can differ from normal mice in how they respond to radiation treatments. The large intestine carrying the gene defect in mice that received staggered doses of radiation was three to four times more resistant to the radiation than in control mice.
   
The researchers, led by Bruce Boman, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Division of Genetic and Preventive Medicine at Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia and at Jefferson\'s Kimmel Cancer Center and Dennis Leeper, Ph.D., professor of radiation oncology at Jefferson Medical College, say these results may have implications for treating patients with colon cancer, which is a  tumor  that frequently has mutations in a gene called APC.
   
They reported their findings this week at the 2006 annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Washington, D.C. (Stem Cell Number and Radiation Resistance During Repair in Colonic Crypts of APC Mice: Abstract no. LB-311).
   
Scientists have known that patients\' colon tumors with APC mutations have an increased amount of survivin, a protein that halts the process of programmed cell death. This increase also appears to be associated with a rise in the number of  stem cells  that sit at the bottom of colonic crypts, tube-like structures that make up the lining of the intestine. Drs. Leeper and Boman wanted to see if there was a difference in stem cell number between normal mice and mice that carry a mutation in APC. To do this, they exposed both normal and mutant mice to radiation, testing their ability to repair the resulting DNA damage. They speculated that increased survivin in the mutant mice might enable more stem cells to survive and affect the response to radiation. The researchers asked if mice with an APC mutation, making them prone to develop colon cancer, are different from normal mice in radiation sensitivity and their ability to repair the damage. Normal cells can repair DNA damage from radiation, Dr. Leeper explains.
   
They measured the survival of colon crypts in the small and large intestines in normal and mutant mice following radiation exposure, looking at the responses to both single doses of radiation and to staggered or \""fractionated\"" doses of radiation, where the second dose is given five hours after the first dose, again causing the DNA repair to kick in.
   
\""In the normal mouse the radiation-induced damage in the intestine is repaired, just as we expected,\"" Dr. Boman explains. In fact, intestinal cells in both the mutant mouse and normal mouse reacted the same to the single dose of radiation.
   
But the mutant mice responded differently to the staggered radiation. \""When we irradiate five hours later when repair has begun, and damage is being repaired, and then a second dose of radiation is given, the mutant mice are resistant,\"" says Dr. Leeper. More specifically, the Jefferson team found that in the large intestine in the mutant mice, the colon crypt cells were more resistant to radiation by a factor of three to four.
   
\""This has never been observed before to my knowledge,\"" Dr. Leeper says. \""This is a novel finding.\"" He notes that the results could have important implications as to how radiation is given to colon cancer patients. \""If you are giving radiation once a day, it shouldn\'t be a problem. But if you are fractionating treatments, given it two or three times a day, this finding could have implications. We would want to make sure that repair processes and signaling receptors come back to baseline before a second dose of  chemotherapy  is given.\""

Research led by the University of Adelaide has found that women whose babies are conceived in winter are more likely to develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy, increasing a range of risk factors for both child and mother.

The study - investigating more than 60,000 births in South Australia over a five-year period - is the first population-based study of its kind to confirm a seasonal variation in gestational diabetes.

Published in the journal BMJ Diabetes Research & Care, the study was led by the Robinson Research Institute at the University of Adelaide, and involved the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and the Pregnancy Outcome Unit of SA Health.

Gestational diabetes mellitus is a serious pregnancy complication characterized by inadequate blood sugar control in pregnancy. Complications of gestational diabetes include excessive birth weight, pre-term birth, low blood sugar (which, in extreme cases, can lead to seizures in the baby), and developing type 2 diabetes later in life.

""Our study is the first of its kind to find strong evidence of a relationship between gestational diabetes and the season in which a child is conceived,"" says lead author Dr Petra Verburg from the University of Groningen, who is currently based at the University of Adelaide's Robinson Research Institute and at the Lyell McEwin Hospital.

The study found that:

""The mechanisms that cause gestational diabetes are still not fully understood,"" Dr Verburg says. ""Previous studies have suggested that meteorological factors, physical activity, diet and vitamin D are risk factors for gestational diabetes, all of which are impacted by the winter season.

""Not only should our results be confirmed in other populations, future research should also investigate other factors that vary with season,"" she says.

Research leader and senior author Professor Claire Roberts, from the University's Robinson Research Institute, says the results continue to show the broader impacts of the increasing body mass index (BMI) in women of reproductive age.

""Elevated BMI and low physical activity are risk factors for gestational diabetes, as well as low socio-economic status. These factors are modifiable, and they represent targets for interventions to prevent the rising tide of gestational diabetes,"" Professor Roberts says.

Based on a Finnish study, persistent smokers may have higher risk of becoming depressed in comparison to never smokers. Also those smokers who quit have an elevated risk of depressive symptoms in the short run. However, in the long run this risk declines to the level of never smokers. In other words, both completely smoke-free life style and successful smoking cessation in the long run seem to protect from depressive symptoms.
   
It is known that  depression  is associated with cigarette smoking, but the nature of this association is discussed under various hypotheses. First, according to the so called self-medication hypothesis, those who suffer from depressive symptoms smoke cigarettes in order to alleviate their symptoms. According to the second assumption, chronic persistent smoking may have a role in the etiology of depression. The third hypothesis suggests that there is a reciprocal mechanism between smoking and depression. The fourth hypothesis says that there are shared underlying genetic factors explaining this co-morbidity.
   
This study conducted in the Department of Public Health at the University of Helsinki explored, which of those assumptions would be supported by the data, when smoking behavior and changes in it is considered as a predictor of depressive symptoms. The researchers had access to the data collected within the Finnish Adult Twin Cohort Project. There were about four thousand male and five thousand female twins, whose health and health behavior were followed-up through 15 years.
   
Data on smoking behavior and changes in it between 1975 and 1981 were analyzed as a predictor of depressive symptoms measured in 1990. The analyses were adjusted for other factors known to predict depression. Because the data consisted of twins it was possible to test the causality between smoking and depression by using twin pairs discordant for depression, where the twin without depression served as a matched control for his/her co-twin with depression. Additionally, it was possible to explore potential shared genetic influences underlying the association.
   
The results suggest that first, persistent chronic cigarette smoking predicts depressive symptoms. However, when adjusted for other factors associated with depression, the elevated risk of persistent smoking remained significant among men only. ""The result that chronic smoking may actually have a role in the etiology of depression, may be surprising, as nicotine as such - in the short term - is assumed to have some positive effects on mood"", says Dr. Tellervo Korhonen from the Department of Public Health at the University of Helsinki, and continues: ""We should look to our results from the long term effects of cigarette smoking for an explanation, from  addiction  mechanisms and from other substances than nicotine within tobacco smoke.""
   
Secondly, there was evidence suggesting that those smokers who had quit had elevated depression risk in the relatively short term. The association of  quitting smoking  and depressive symptoms gives us indirect evidence on the self-medication hypothesis. Dr. Korhonen emphasizes, however, the further evidence within the same study showing that those smokers who had quit successfully and remained abstinent through the follow-up did not have elevated depression risk compared to the never smokers. ""This may reflect a relatively long recovery process from the adverse effects of cigarette smoking"" Dr. Korhonen continues.
   
""The mechanisms underlying the association between smoking and depression are very complicated. Although nicotine as such may have short term positive effects on concentration and possibly on mood, long term exposure to tobacco smoke may be one risk factor in the development of depression. However, this mechanism is still relatively unknown. Thus, there is need for further research and evidence in order to make an unambiguous statement that 'smoking cigarettes causes depression'. Examination of potential shared genetic vulnerability for both tobacco dependence and depression is among the further challenges."" According to Korhonen, one can already say that - as in prevention of many other diseases - also in prevention of depression - smoke-free life and successful smoking cessation seem to have a positive impact.

Problems with insulin secretion experienced by people with Type 2 diabetes, parallel similar problems with insulin-secreting beta cells in many individuals with Down syndrome.  A new study, published in PLOS Genetics by Professor Damien Keating of Flinders University and colleagues, has used this knowledge to identify a single gene that may cause these problems.

Many individuals with Down syndrome experience lower insulin secretion, mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress in the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas; conditions that also appear in people with Type 2 diabetes. Down syndrome is the most common genetic disorder and occurs when a person has an extra copy of some or all of chromosome 21. To identify genes duplicated in Down syndrome that contribute to problems with insulin secretion, scientists screened the genes of four mouse models of the disorder - two had high blood sugar and two did not. They narrowed down the list by comparing it to genes overexpressed in beta cells from humans with Type 2 diabetes. The comparison identified a single gene, RCAN1, which, when overexpressed in mice, causes them to have abnormal mitochondria in their beta cells, produce less ATP and secrete less insulin in the presence of glucose.

The results of the study not only explain why individuals with Down syndrome are more likely to have Type 1 diabetes, but have revealed the function of a gene that may be playing a lead role in development of Type 2 diabetes in the general population. This approach could be applied to other health disorders with symptoms that also appear in individuals with Down syndrome.

According to a handful of recent studies, okra may reduce symptoms of diabetes - a group of diseases that includes type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes.

Diabetes claimed the lives of 75,578 Americans in 2013, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2014, 8.5 percent of adults worldwide had the condition, the World Health Organization (WHO) report. By 2030, diabetes may be the seventh leading cause of death. 

A number of factors increase a person's risk of developing diabetes, including a family history of the disease. Lifestyle factors also play a role, so doctors routinely recommend diet changes and increased exercise to reduce blood sugar levels.

Okra may help reduce blood sugar levels in some people with diabetes. Research into the effects of this seedy vegetable is still in the early stages, but the results are promising. 

Contents of this article:

Okra thrives in temperate climates, producing large hibiscus-like flowers that eventually give rise to green seed pods. It is a member of the mallow family, which includes a number of other popular plants, including hibiscus, cocoa, and cotton.

Scientifically known as Abelmoschus esculentus, okra may have been grown as long ago as 2000 BCE in Egypt.

Okra's flavor is mild, and the entire seed pod can be eaten. This vegetable-like fruit also has a long history in traditional medicine.

Kew Royal Botanic Gardens report that in Eastern traditional medicine, okra leaves and fruit were used as pain relievers, moisturizers, and to treat urinary disorders. In Congolese medicine, okra is used to encourage a safe delivery during childbirth. 
 
Diabetes can often be well-managed with increasing a hormone called insulin and other medical therapies. However, some people with diabetes wish to avoid regular insulin injections. Others experience blood sugar dips and other unpleasant side effects, and diabetes medications do not work for everyone. 

The possibility that a readily available seed pod could help control diabetes is an exciting one. But there is no evidence yet that okra can cure diabetes. So far, the research on okra has only looked at its effects on animals. Human bodies are similar to animals, but not all research on animals has worked out in humans. 

A 2005 study published in Planta Medica investigated the effects of okra on rats with diabetes. A substance called myricetin is present in okra and some other foods, including red wine and tea.

Researchers isolated myricetin from okra, then administered it to the rat. The treatment increased absorption of sugar in the rats' muscles, lowering their blood sugar. 

A 2012 Food Science and Human Wellness review points to a number of other laboratory and animal studies that have linked myricetin to lower blood sugar. The study argues that myricetin may also reduce other risk factors for diabetes. 

A 2011 study published in ISRN Pharmaceutics found a link between okra and decreased blood sugar spikes after eating.

Researchers fed rats liquid sugar as well as purified okra through a feeding tube. Rats who consumed the okra experienced a reduction in blood sugar spikes after feeding. The study's authors think this is because the okra blocked the absorption of sugar in the intestines. 

The study also explored possible interactions between okra and metformin, a drug that can reduce blood sugar in type 2 diabetes. Okra appeared to also block absorption of metformin. This suggests that okra could reduce the effectiveness of metformin, and should therefore not be eaten at the same time as the drug. 

A 2011 study published in the Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences points to a link between eating okra and lower blood sugar. The researchers allowed the blood sugar of rats with diabetes to stay level for 14 days. They then gave the rats powdered okra peel extracts and seeds dosages of up to 2,000 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. 

There were no poisonous effects linked with these relatively high doses of okra. The rats that ate okra had reduced blood sugar levels after up to 28 days of eating okra. The study ended on day 28, so it is unclear if the effects on blood sugar levels would have lasted longer. 

Few studies have linked okra to negative side effects, but some negative side effects are possible:

Even if okra proves to be ineffective in fighting diabetes, it remains a safe snack for people with diabetes. A single serving of 100 grams contains just 30 calories, but offers a number of nutritional benefits:

Okra is rich in protective substances known as antioxidants, including myricetin. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, antioxidants may reduce oxidative stress, a process that damages cells in the body. Oxidative stress plays a role in the development of diabetes, as well as diseases such as:

In addition to its antioxidant benefits, okra may also reduce tiredness. A 2015 study published in Nutrients found that substances found in okra seeds known as polyphenols and flavonoids could reduce fatigue. 

Okra thrives when the soil temperature is above 65°F and is heat-tolerant throughout the summer. The Old Farmer's Almanac report that the first harvest is about 2 months from the date of planting.

The plants are tall, growing at least 2 to 3 feet, and so need space to grow. They may also need to be staked. 

Okra is safe to eat raw or cooked. In some regions, fried okra is a popular side dish. Okra also goes well with some soups like gumbo, salads, and can be pickled.

Baked purple-fleshed potatoes suppressed the growth of colon cancer tumors in petri dishes and in mice by targeting the cancer's stem cells. Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. and responsible for more than 50,000 deaths annually, according to the American Cancer Society.

Attacking stem cells is an effective way to counter cancer, according to Jairam K.P. Vanamala, associate professor of food sciences, Penn State and faculty member, at the Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute.

""You might want to compare cancer stem cells to roots of the weeds,"" Vanamala said. ""You may cut the weed, but as long as the roots are still there, the weeds will keep growing back and, likewise, if the cancer stem cells are still present, the cancer can still grow and spread.""

The researchers, who released their findings in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, currently online, used a baked purple potato because potatoes are widely consumed and typically baked before they are consumed, especially in western countries. They wanted to make sure the vegetables maintained their anti-cancer properties even after cooking.

In the initial laboratory study, the researchers found that the baked potato extract suppressed the spread of colon cancer stem cells while increasing their deaths. Researchers then tested the effect of whole baked purple potatoes on mice with colon cancer and found similar results. The portion size for a human would be about the same as eating a medium size purple-fleshed potato for lunch and dinner, or one large purple-fleshed potato per day.

According to the researchers, there may be several substances in purple potatoes that work simultaneously on multiple pathways to help kill the colon cancer stem cells, including anthocyanins and chlorogenic acid, and resistant starch.

""Our earlier work and other research studies suggest that potatoes, including purple potatoes, contain resistant starch, which serves as a food for the gut bacteria, that the bacteria can covert to beneficial short-chain fatty acids such as butyric acid,"" Vanamala said. ""The butyric acid regulates immune function in the gut, suppresses chronic inflammation and may also help to cause cancer cells to self-destruct.""

In addition to resistant starch, the same color compounds that give potatoes, as well as other fruits and vegetables, a rainbow of vibrant colors may be effective in suppressing cancer growth, he added.

""When you eat from the rainbow, instead of one compound, you have thousands of compounds, working on different pathways to suppress the growth of cancer stem cells,"" said Vanamala. ""Because cancer is such a complex disease, a silver bullet approach is just not possible for most cancers.""

The next step would be to test the whole food approach using purple potatoes in humans for disease prevention and treatment strategies. The researchers also plan to test the purple potatoes on other forms of cancer.

Using evidenced-based foods as a proper cancer prevention strategy could complement current and future anti-cancer drug therapies. Vanamala said that foods could actually offer a healthier way to prevent cancer because they often have limited side effects compared to drug treatments.

""Indeed, we have seen that the animals that consumed purple potatoes are healthier compared to animals that received drug treatment,"" said Vanamala.

Purple potatoes could be potentially used in both primary and secondary prevention strategies for cancer, Vanamala suggested. Primary prevention is aimed at stopping the initial attack of cancer, while secondary prevention refers to helping patients in remission remain cancer-free.

Most of the funding in cancer research currently goes to cancer cures but not to prevention, Vanamala said. However, as cancer incidences are predicted to surge in the next two decades, an equal emphasis on both food-based cancer prevention and therapeutic drug approaches should be used to counter the growing epidemic of cancer in the U.S. and around the world.

COLUMBUS , Ohio - Persistent  fatigue  immediately following birth may be the best signal to determine whether a woman will develop  postpartum depression , a new study suggests.
   
Women who said they still felt extremely fatigued two weeks after having a baby were more likely to suffer from postpartum depression a new study suggests.
   
""All mothers are tired right after having a baby - it helps them get the rest that they needs to recover and heal from the physical and mental stressors of childbirth,"" said Elizabeth Corwin, the study's lead author and an associate professor of nursing at Ohio State University. ""But for most women, fatigue steadily fades within the first two weeks of giving birth.
   
What is unusual - and detrimental - is a fatigue that persists, the researchers say.
   
In this study it was fatigue - not  stress  or a history of  depression  - that was the best indicator of which women went on to develop postpartum depression.
   
""For these women, the constant fatigue came first, and depression followed,"" Corwin said.
   
The study appears in a recent issue of the Journal of Obstetric, Gynecological and Neonatal Nursing.
   
Corwin and her colleagues recruited pregnant women who were near the end of their third trimester. A total of 31 women completed the study. Each woman carried her baby to a full term and delivered vaginally without complications.
   
A researcher met each woman at her home when she was between 36 and 38 weeks pregnant. The participants were asked to complete questionnaires on fatigue, stress and both symptoms and history of depression. They were also asked to provide a saliva sample which the researchers used to measure levels of cortisol, a hormone related to stress.
   
Each woman was asked to call one of the researchers as soon as possible after giving birth. At that point, the researcher arranged to visit the woman about seven days after she delivered. The researcher also visited that same woman two weeks and four weeks after delivery.
   
At each postpartum visit, the women filled out the same questionnaires on depressive symptoms, stress and feelings of fatigue and also provided saliva samples.
   
By the end of the fourth week, 11 of the 31 women in the study showed symptoms of depression - seven of these women had a family history of depression. Of this group of seven women, four also had a personal history of depression.
   
And 10 of the 11 women (91 percent) who showed symptoms of postpartum depression during the fourth and final week of the study had also reported higher-than-normal levels of fatigue two weeks earlier. Only one of the 11 women who went on to demonstrate symptoms of depression had not reported excessive fatigue at that visit.
   
""A personal history of depression is an excellent way to predict which women are at risk for postpartum depression,"" Corwin. ""Still, using that as the sole screening tool would have left seven of the women undiagnosed.
   
""Likewise, a family history of depression is a risk factor,"" she continued. ""But by using family history alone we would have missed four women who went on to develop signs of depression.""
   
While these women reported that they also felt more stressed than normal, elevated stress levels, which were based on the women's answers to the stress questionnaire, weren't enough to predict which women would ultimately develop postpartum depression. Most of the women in the study reported higher-than-usual levels of stress during the first month after having their babies.
   
Also, cortisol levels were highest for all of the women in the study at the end of their pregnancies and steadily declined during the month after they gave birth. This ruled out using cortisol as an indicator of difference in stress between women who went on to develop depression and those who did not.
   
""It was ultimately fatigue that best predicted which women would develop postpartum depression,"" Corwin said.
   
It's estimated that 12 percent of women develop major depression within a year of giving birth, while about 19 percent develop minor forms of the illness.
   
Postpartum depression is detrimental on many levels. For one, it interrupts maternal-infant bonding, which may have negative effects on infant behavioral and cognitive development. It can also affect a mother's self-esteem and her relationship with her partner and other children.
   
There currently is no standard way to screen for postpartum depression. A mother at risk of developing the illness often goes undiagnosed until several weeks after her baby is born. Treatment typically includes counseling or anti-depressants or a combination of both.
   
""One of the problems with postpartum depression is that women usually aren't diagnosed until the disease is already established,"" Corwin said. ""If a woman's health care provider knew early on that a patient was slipping down this slope, he or she could intervene. It may not take much to screen for it, either - the questions in the fatigue test that we used took about two to three minutes to answer.""
   
Corwin conducted the study with colleagues from Pennsylvania State University.

A recent scientific discovery could herald the introduction of fast, effective treatments for  cancer  and viruses.    

In a paper published in the May edition of Nature Biotechnology, scientists describe how they have manipulated a process that occurs naturally throughout the human body, into a potential therapeutic tool.    

\""The process, called RNA interference, blocks the production of proteins that create cancer and viruses,\"" said research leader and Director of the Monash Institute of Medical Research (MIMR), Professor Bryan Williams.    

\""We\'ve exploited this process by creating short interfering RNA, or siRNA, that are being developed into drugs to fight viruses and cancer,\"" he said. \""We\'ve now taken this a step further and worked out how we can create siRNA with different cellular properties to target different diseases.\""    

While previous studies had demonstrated siRNA had the potential to be a potent anti-cancer and anti-viral agent, Professor Williams had shown there was a danger siRNA-based drugs could cause a dangerous inflammatory response.    

Professor Williams and his team have now discovered the physical structure of siRNA are key to creating effective anti-cancer and anti-viral drugs. This will allow both the development of siRNA-based drugs to react differently for different diseases.    

\""By \'tweaking\' the structure of siRNA to target specific diseases, we can dictate whether we want a particular siRNA-based drug to block or promote an immune response, to increase the effectiveness of the treatment,\"" he said.    

\""While our research is at an early stage, human trials using siRNA are currently underway in the USA and Europe. We\'re confident our have a significant impact on the way siRNA is being developed as a weapon in the fight against viruses and cancer,\"" said Professor Williams.

Their experience treating a rare type of abdominal  cancer  has helped physicians at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center make a new discovery that may change the way it is diagnosed. The results are reported in the May issue of the American Journal of Surgical Pathology.
   
""Our study suggests that tumors of the appendix that have spread through the abdominal cavity all qualify as cancer,"" said Robert F. Bradley, M.D., principal investigator. ""Previously, some of the tumors were classified as 'benign,' which we believe gives a false sense of how the  tumor  will behave.""
   
Bradley, a pathology resident, and colleagues focused on 101 patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei, a rare form of cancer of the lining of the abdominal cavity. The cancer, which produces mucin, a ""jelly-like"" substance, usually originates in the appendix or colon and spreads to the abdominal lining. Bradley evaluated all available microscopic slides in cases proven to come from the appendix.
   
Wake Forest is one of a few centers in the country that offer a combined treatment - surgery to remove the tumor and then infusion of heated  chemotherapy  drugs into the abdominal cavity. Because it treats patients from all over the country with the disease, Wake Forest had a unique opportunity to clear up confusion about its diagnosis.
   
""Because it is so rare - less than 0.1 percent of appendices are removed for cancer -- the disease has been plagued with controversy and confusing terminology,"" said Bradley.
   
Currently, many pathologists who study sections of the tumor after surgery classify it into three general categories: high-grade cancer, low-grade cancer, and benign. All of the patients normally receive the same treatment - the grade of the tumor indicates how patients will respond.
   
The investigators from Wake Forest compared the diagnoses made using these three grades with patients' outcome after receiving standardized treatment. Patients in the study, which is the largest to date of pseudomyxoma peritonei that originated from the appendix, were treated from 1993 to 2005.
   
The researchers found one-year, three-year and five-year survival rates were not significantly different for patients in the ""low-grade cancer"" and ""benign"" categories. However, patients in the ""high-grade"" category had significantly worse survival.
   
""Hopefully this will help resolve the confusion in diagnosis,"" said Bradley. ""Our study shows that there is no separate 'benign' variant of the disease. Instead, physicians should expect those tumors that look 'benign' microscopically to behave like low-grade cancer. We now combine those cases into one diagnosis of low-grade  carcinoma , for which the prognosis should be equally favorable with adequate treatment.""
   
Bradley said the way the disease is diagnosed has implications for how it is viewed and treated.
   
""We hope this will lead to a more standardized diagnosis so that these patients' doctors understand exactly what it means,"" he said.
   
About 66 percent of patients with the low-grade variant who are aggressively treated with surgery and abdominal chemotherapy survive at least five years and are potentially cured, Bradley said. The chemotherapy treatment is known as intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy (IPHC).
   
Last year, Wake Forest researchers reported on their experience using the combination of surgery and IPHC for tumors that had spread from the appendix, small bowels and ovaries. They also use the treatment for tumors that have spread from the colon, rectum and stomach.
   
Surgery alone has been shown to have limited effectiveness, but the combination therapy improves overall survival and quality of life in selected patients. For example, patients whose cancer had spread from the small bowel had a mean survival of almost 4 years with combination therapy, compared to 3.1 months for patients who received only traditional treatment.

Increasing exposure to outdoor light is the key to reducing the myopia (short-sightedness) epidemic in children, according to ground-breaking research by Australian optometrists.

Optometrist and lead researcher on the project, Associate Professor Scott Read who is the director of research at QUT's School of Optometry and Vision Science, said children need to spend more than an hour and preferably at least two hours a day outside to help prevent myopia from developing and progressing.

Speaking at the Australian Vision Convention in Queensland on the weekend, Professor Read said it was not 'near work' on computer and other screens causing myopia, but a lack of adequate outdoor light.

""While screens are contributing to children spending more time indoors than in previous years, the research shows they are not the direct cause of the increased incidence of myopia,"" he said.

""Optometrists need to make their patients aware that less than 60 minutes' exposure to light outdoors per day is a risk factor for myopia.

""It looks like even for those with myopia already, increasing time outside is likely to reduce progression.""

Optometry Australia president Kate Gifford said ""this new finding is of significant importance in our endeavour to mitigate the growing rate of myopia in children.""

In February, it was announced that half the world's population will be short-sighted by 2050 with many at risk of blindness.

The global study, published by the Brien Holden Vision Institute, forecasts that 10 per cent of the world's population will be at risk of blindness by 2050 if steps are not taken to stop myopia turning into high myopia (requiring glasses with a prescription of minus five or stronger).

The QUT study measured children's eye growth via study participants wearing wristwatch light sensors to record light exposure and physical activity for a fortnight during warmer then colder months to give an overall measurement of their typical light exposure.

""Children exposed to the least outdoor light had faster eye growth and hence faster myopia progression,"" Professor Read said.

Research shows that if an infant is born full term, they can expect to experience better health and cognitive functioning while growing up and as they become adults.

Children who are born late may have a higher risk of health complications around the time of birth, but there is little information about the long-term cognitive and physical outcomes of being born after full term.

David N. Figlio, Ph.D., from Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, and colleagues looked at the records for more than 1.4 million children in Florida. 

All the children were single births, as opposed to twins, and 80 percent of them attended public schools. They were all born between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation. The year of birth ranged from 1994-2002.

The researchers looked at three school-based measures of cognitive levels and two measures of physical status. They carried out the data analysis from April 2013-January 2016.

The measures of cognitive outcome were:


The measures of physical outcome were:

This included any Exceptional Student Education placement, for example, because of speech, orthopedic, or sensory impairment or conditions necessitating longs stays in the hospital or at home.

The team compared the outcomes for late-term children, born at 41 weeks, and those born full term, at 39 or 40 weeks.

For all three cognitive measures, infants who were born late achieved higher scores than those born full term.

Results indicate that those born in week 41 had higher average test scores in elementary and middle school, a 2.8 percent greater chance of being classed as gifted, and a 3.1 percent lower probability of poor cognitive outcomes. However, they also had a 2.1 percent higher rate of physical disabilities at school age, and they were more likely to have had health problems at the time of birth.

The findings suggest that there may be a ""tradeoff"" between physical and cognitive outcomes in those who are born late, say the authors.

Those who are born late appear to have a greater risk of abnormal conditions at birth and physical challenges during childhood, but they also have an increased chance of higher cognitive functioning.

The authors note that the results could help parents and doctors when making decisions about inducing delivery.

They say:
""While this article does not constitute a course of action for clinicians, our findings provide useful long-term information to complement the extant short-term data for expectant parents and physicians who are considering whether to induce delivery at full term or wait another week until late term.""
The study had a number of limitations. 

These include the fact that there may be different ways of measuring term. A possible source of bias could be that the children all came from families where either English or Spanish was spoken at home. In all the pregnancies, antenatal care began in the first semester. Finally, some children - for example, cases where the mother was over 35 years at the time of birth - were not included.

Red means ""Green light, go for it!"" Green means: ""hmm, better not!"" Like an upside down traffic light in our brain, color helps us decide whether or not to eat something. This, according to a study at the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) in Trieste and recently published in the journal Scientific Reports stating that vision is the main sense we use to guide us in food choices. To evaluate calorie intake, we rely on a ""color code.""

""According to some theories, our visual system evolved to easily identify particularly nutritious berries, fruits and vegetables from jungle foliage,"" says Raffaella Rumiati, SISSA neuroscientist and coordinator of the new study. The human visual system is trichromatic: in the retina, the light-sensitive organ of the eye, there are three classes of photoreceptors (cones) tuned preferentially to three different bands of the visible spectrum. This implies that we can see a large number of colors (more than monochromatic and dichromatic animals, less than those with 4, even 5 types of photoreceptor). ""We are particularly efficient at distinguishing red from green,"" says Rumiati. This sophistication testifies to the fact that we are ""visual animals,"" unlike others, dogs, for example, who depend on their sense of smell. ""It is mainly the color of food that guides us, and our experiments show how,"" explains Rumiati. ""To date, only a few studies have been focused on the topic.""

What do we look for in food? Nutrition, of course, or calorie-dense content, and high protein. ""In natural foods, color is a good predictor of calories,"" explains Francesco Foroni, SISSA researcher and first author of the study. ""The redder an unprocessed food is, the more likely it is to be nutritious, while green foods tend to be low in calories."" Our visual system is clearly adapted to this regularity. ""The participants in our experiments judged foods whose color tended towards red as higher in calories, while the opposite was true for greens,"" continues Giulio Pergola, a researcher at the University of Bari, and one of the authors of the study. ""This is also true for processed, or cooked foods, where color loses its effectiveness as an indicator of calories.""

Actually, the scientific literature shows clearly that cooked foods are favored over natural foods and the phenomenon has been observed even in other species besides humans. ""Cooked foods are always preferred because, compared to natural foods, there is more nutrition for the same quantity,"" explains Rumiati. ""With cooked foods, however, the dominance of red over green no longer provides reliable information, which might lead us to believe that the brain would not apply the rule to processed foods. On the contrary, it does, which hints at the presence of ancient evolutionary mechanisms from before the introduction of cooking.""

Another nod in favor of this hypothesis is the fact that the color code in the Rumiati and colleagues experiments does not come into play for items other than food: ""The preference for red over green is not observed with non-edible objects,"" says Rumiati. ""This means that the color code of the visual system activates correctly only with food stimuli.""

Our findings, besides increasing our knowledge of the visual system, offer interesting possibilities on many fronts which could have an important impact on the public health: marketing food, for example, and treating eating disorders. ""Much is being done today to encourage healthier eating,"" notes Rumiati. ""For example, trying to convince the people to eat foods lower in calories."" Some countries propose bans on certain types of products, such as carbonated soft drinks and high fat foods. In some cases, there is a disclaimer on the packaging, as with cigarettes. Perhaps food color could be used to produce significant results, even if artificial. ""

Dr. Jason Gilliland, a Scientist at Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Health Research Institute and Director of the Human Environments Analysis Laboratory at Western University, is combining health research with geography to understand the connection between children's nutrition and their local neighbourhoods. In an innovative study, Dr. Gilliland and his team used GPS technology to provide evidence that adolescents' exposure to junk food outlets during trips to and from school affects their likelihood of making a junk food purchase.

The study followed 654 students, aged 9 to 13, from across London and Middlesex County, Ontario. Each student was given a portable GPS logger to track their trips to and from school over the course of two weeks. The GPS logger identified each time a student entered within 50 metres of a junk food outlet, those stores or restaurants where students might make an unhealthy food purchase, and recorded their time exposed. Each student was also given an activity diary to record any junk food purchases during those trips.

Results showed that exposure to junk food outlets had a significant effect on a child's likelihood of making a junk food purchase. Of all trips where a child was exposed to a junk food outlet, 1 in 20 included a junk food purchase. The length of time that a child was exposed significantly increased their chances of making a purchase, increasing from 1.7% at less than one minute of exposure to 16% at 16 to 17 minutes of exposure. In addition, trips home from school were much more likely to be associated with a junk food purchase than trips to school.

""This study provides strong evidence that a child's surrounding food environment affects their food purchasing behaviour,"" says Dr. Gilliland, also Director of the Urban Development Program and Professor in the Department of Geography at Western University. ""Unlike past studies, these results provide strong accuracy through the use of GPS technology to more precisely capture exposure.""

Dr. Gilliland's team also found that trips made by car were much more likely to result in a junk food purchase than those made by an active mode of travel. These odds increased significantly with length of exposure. Exposure while riding the bus did not result in a junk food purchase, due to limited mobility and school board restrictions.

""These results show that trips by car, under adult supervision, are more likely to result in a junk food purchase,"" says Dr. Gilliland. ""This suggests the powerful influence that parents can have on their children's eating habits and the need to be mindful of this. It also suggests that an active mode of travel may be healthier, not only for physical activity, but also for nutrition.""

The study found that trips made by females were more likely to result in a junk food purchase at all levels of exposure than those made by males. Females were 2.5 times more likely than males to make a junk food purchase after 5 minutes of exposure and 3 times more likely to make a purchase after 15 minutes of exposure. Dr. Gilliland suggests this may be due to female adolescents having more money in the Canadian culture of babysitting, but also cites the importance of health promotion campaigns that target males and females separately.

""Overall, this study's findings have significant implications for municipal planners, school board officials, public health officials and other decision makers,"" says Dr. Gilliland. ""This provides clear evidence that bylaws and policies should be enacted that restrict the concentration of junk food outlets around schools.""

In addition, the study highlights the need to educate adolescents in making healthy food choices. One way Dr. Gilliland and his colleagues are working to make healthy eating attractive is through the use of a smartphone app - SmartAPPetite. Dr. Gilliland created this app to remove barriers to finding local and healthy foods in southwestern Ontario. ""We may not be able to change the landscape of our food environments overnight,"" says Dr. Gilliland. ""But we can work to promote healthy eating in innovative ways.""

This special issue includes a foreward from the Honourable Jane Philpott, Canada's Minister for Health, stating the federal government's commitment to supporting Canadians in making healthy, informed food choices. The study was jointly funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, with seed funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Additional support was provided by Children's Health Foundation and Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Health Research Institute.

Recent studies conducted at the San Francisco VA Medical Center suggest two possible mechanisms for the widely recognized link between  depression  and adverse outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease: lack of adherence to medication regimens and increased levels of norepinephrine, a  stress  hormone.    

""Patients with depression are more likely to suffer  heart attacks  and  heart failure , and more likely to die of  heart disease , and no one knows why,"" notes Mary Whooley, MD, a staff physician at SFVAMC and the principal investigator of both studies. ""These results give us two intriguing clues: one behavioral, one biological.""    

One study looked at the association between depression and self-reported medication adherence in 940 patients with stable  coronary heart disease , 204 of whom were diagnosed as depressed. Fourteen percent of the depressed patients reported not taking their medications as prescribed over a 30-day period, compared with 5 percent of the non-depressed patients.    

The study appears in the November 28 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine.    

Another study examined 24-hour urinary norepinephrine levels in 598 coronary disease patients, 106 of whom had depressive symptoms. A total of 9.4 percent of the depressed participants had a urinary norepinephrine value above the normal range, compared with 3.3 percent of the non-depressed participants. In addition, the more depressive symptoms a participant had, the higher the participant's norepinephrine levels.    

This paper appears in the November 2005 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry.    

Neither study indicates a mechanism for adverse coronary outcomes ""because we were only looking at cross-sectional data,"" stresses Whooley, who is also an associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.    

However, she says, both papers suggest further avenues of research.    

The medication-adherence study raises the possibility that because they're depressed, patients simply aren't doing what they're supposed to do to take care of themselves, and this in turn implies a potential treatment, according to Whooley. ""If you get rid of the depression, you might get rid of the non-adherence.""    

The norepinephrine study, on the other hand, suggests that depression could make heart disease patients ""more vulnerable to the ill effects of elevated stress hormones,"" she speculates. While there was no association between norepinephrine levels and baseline severity of heart disease in the current study, ""that doesn't necessarily mean that patients with elevated norepinephrine won't have worse outcomes over time,"" she cautions.    

The next thing to do, says Whooley, is ""figure out which of these factors - behavioral or biological - accounts for increased risk of heart disease, or whether it's some combination of the two. And that's what we're working on now.""    

Whooley and her co-authors are conducting studies that will investigate whether medication non-adherence or elevated norepinephrine actually predict increased risk of heart disease over time.    

Participants in both of the current studies are enrolled in the Heart and Soul Study, an ongoing, multi-center, prospective cohort study of psychosocial factors and health outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease that is in its fifth year. The study is sponsored by the Department of Veterans Affairs Epidemiology Program, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the American Federation for Aging Research.    

""The overall goal of the Heart and Soul Study is to try to understand why depression predicts adverse cardiovascular outcomes,"" explains Whooley, who is the study's principal investigator. ""Eventually, we hope to help these patients with the treatment they deserve, and by doing so, decrease the overall burden of death from cardiac disease.""    

Co-authors of the medication study include Anil Gehi, MD, and Donald Haas, MD, of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, and Sharon Pipkin, MPH, of the San Francisco Department of Public Health.    

The medication study was funded by grants from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, plus grants from the American Federation for Aging Research and the Nancy Kirwan Heart Research Fund that were administered by the Northern California Institute for Research and Education.    

Co-authors of the norepinephrine study include Christian Otte, MD, of the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany; Thomas C. Neylan, MD, of SFVAMC and UCSF; Sharon S. Pipkin, MPH, of SFVAMC, and Warren S. Browner, MD, MPH, of California Pacific Medical Center, San Francisco.    

The norepinephrine study was funded by grants from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and a grant from the Ischemia Research and Education Foundation that was administered by NCIRE.

The study in nearly 800 000 patients suggests that limiting consumption of carbonated beverages may be beneficial for health.

""Some epidemiologic studies have shown a positive correlation between the consumption of soft drinks and the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke, while other reports have demonstrated that the intake of green tea and coffee reduced the risk and mortality of CVD,"" said principal investigator Professor Keijiro Saku, Dean and professor of cardiology at Fukuoka University in Japan. ""Carbonated beverages, or sodas, have frequently been demonstrated to increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and CVD, such as subclinical cardiac remodeling and stroke. However, until now the association between drinking large amounts of carbonated beverages and fatal CVD, or out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) of cardiac origin, was unclear.""

The study compared the age-adjusted incidence of OHCAs to the consumption of various beverages per person between 2005 and 2011 in the 47 prefectures of Japan. It included 797 422 patients who had OHCAs of cardiac and non-cardiac origin from the All-Japan Utstein Registry of the Fire and Disaster Management Agency. Data on the consumption of the various beverages per person was obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan, using expenditure on beverages as a proxy measure.

The analysis focused on the 785 591 OHCA cases that received resuscitation, of which 435 064 (55.4%) were of cardiac origin and 350 527 (44.6%) were of non-cardiac origin. Those of non-cardiac origin included cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, malignant tumour, and exogenous disease (4.8%, 6.1%, 3.5%, and 18.9%, respectively).

The researchers found that expenditures on carbonated beverages were significantly associated with OHCAs of cardiac (r=0.30, p=0.04) (Figure 1), but not non-cardiac origin (r=-0.03, p=0.8).

Expenditures on other beverages, including green tea, black tea, coffee, cocoa, fruit or vegetable juice, fermented milk beverage, milk and mineral water were not significantly associated with OHCAs of cardiac origin.

""Carbonated beverage consumption was significantly and positively associated with OHCAs of cardiac origin in Japan, indicating that beverage habits may have an impact on fatal CVD,"" said Professor Saku. ""The acid in carbonated beverages might play an important role in this association.""

Professor Saku concluded: ""Our data on carbonated beverage consumption is based on expenditure and the association with OHCA is not causal. But the findings do indicate that limiting consumption of carbonated beverages could be beneficial for health.""",0

The Swiss pharmaceutical company, Roche, has announced plans to seek a licence to allow prescribing in Europe of its novel  cancer  drug Xeloda? for  stomach cancer .  Xeloda, also known as capecitabine, is an oral  chemotherapy  drug that is activated to a cancer-killing agent called 5-flurouracil (5-FU) within cancer cells themselves. Unlike traditional chemotherapy, which is given as an intravenous infusion and attacks healthy cells as well as cancer cells, Xeloda can be taken at home rather than in hospital and produces less of the severe side effects associated with intravenous chemotherapy such as  diarrhoea ,  fatigue  and vomiting.    
 
The drug is currently available to treat breast and  colorectal cancer . But new data presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference last month show that it is at least as effective as current chemotherapy treatments for stomach cancer and dramatically reduced the amount of time patients needed to visit hospital for treatment. Professor Chris Twelves, NTRAC Professor of Clinical Cancer Pharmacology and Oncology at the University of Leeds in the UK, said: ?Compared to the current, standard treatment Xeloda has the additional benefit of reducing that amount of time to only one day, which helps patients to live as normal a life as possible.?    
 
Jonathan Dickinson, Life Cycle Leader - Xeloda, told Medical News Today: ?Roche plans to file in the next month or so for a gastric cancer indication for Xeloda in Europe. The label will be for advanced gastric cancer, because that is what the data at this stage supports. Data in the future may support an indication for early gastric cancer.?    
 
Gastric cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide1. ?For many patients with gastric cancer, the prognosis is poor. New developments in this area are obviously encouraging for patients and their families,? said Jonathan Dickinson.    
 
The study supporting the licence application and presented at ASCO was based on 316 advanced stomach cancer patients. It showed that patients receiving a combination of Xeloda and cisplatin lived at least as long without the cancer progressing as those treated with the standard chemotherapy regime of intravenous 5-FU and cisplatin. The median progression-free survival was 5.6 months in the Xeloda group compared to 5 months in the standard regime group.  
In a second study also presented at ASCO, the largest-ever phase III study in advanced oesophagogastric cancer, the REAL 2 study, revealed that Xeloda can replace 5-FU and oxaliplatin can replace cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced oesophagus and stomach cancer.  Standard treatment for oesophagogastric cancer in many countries is the combination of epirubicin, cisplatin and 5-FU.    
 
Professor David Cunningham from the Royal Marsden Hospital in London said: ?Xeloda can now be considered as a treatment option for oesophagogastric cancer, replacing 5-FU, as it provides the optimal balance between efficacy, safety and convenience for patients.?    
 
The REAL 2 study showed that patients treated with the combination of Xeloda plus oxaliplatin and epirubicin lived significantly longer, compared to patients treated with the standard chemotherapy regime. In this study, 1,002 advanced oesophagogastric cancer patients were treated with one of four regimes to compare the effect on overall survival between Xeloda and 5-FU and the oxaliplatin and cisplatin-containing arms. Patients in the Xeloda-containing arms lived at least as long as those on the 5-FU arms. Patients in the Xeloda plus oxaliplatin and epirubicin group had an overall longer survival than patients in any of the other treatment groups (11.2 months versus 9.3 months and 9.9 months).    
 
Xeloda, already licensed in 90 countries worldwide, has been shown to be effective, safe, simple and convenient oral chemotherapy. Roche received marketing authorisation for Xeloda as first-line monotherapy in the treatment of metastatic colorectal caner in most countries in 2001. It has also been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adjuvant (post-surgery) treatment of  colon cancer  in March and June 2005, respectively.    
 
Xeloda is licensed in combination with Taxotere? (docetaxel) in women with metastatic  breast cancer  and whose disease has progressed following intravenous chemotherapy with anthracyclines. Xeloda monotherapy is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer that is resistant to other chemotherapy drugs.    
 
Further data presented at ASCO showed that Xeloda plus paclitaxel was equally effective and safer than the combination of an anthracycline (epirubicin) plus paclitaxel in advanced breast cancer. ?Anthracyclines are an important part of breast cancer therapy but the risk of progressive  heart failure  after receiving a cumulative dose restricts their use. This new study demonstrates that Xeloda combinations can offer patients all the good of anthracyclines without the bad effects,? said lead investigator Dr L?ck from the Horst-Schmidt Clinic, Wiesbaden, Germany.   
 
Dr L?ck's study in 340 metastatic breast cancer patients showed that progression-free survival was 12.3 months in the non-anthracycline Xeloda regimen versus 11.8 months in the anthracycline-containing regimen.

152,36187,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/47611.php,Study Indicates Heart Damage From Some Cancer Drugs Worsens Over The Years,Cancer / Oncology,Cancer / Oncology,Cardiovascular / Cardiology,,,5,3,3,3,5,3,4,4,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,,,,,"
 Life-long monitoring important for patients treated by anthracylines say Dutch researchers    

It is well documented that some anti-cancer drugs can damage the heart, but a long-term follow-up of children and young adults who had doxorubicin[1] treatment for bone tumours suggests that the damage gets progressively worse as the years go on.    

In a study published on-line today (Thursday 20 July) in Annals of Oncology[2] researchers from the University Medical Centre at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, say that all patients treated with drugs known as anthracyclines should have life-long cardiac monitoring.    

Their study followed 22 patients, who had been treated with moderate or high doses of doxorubicin for osteogenic  sarcomas  or malignant fibrous histiocytomas, for a median time of 22 years (between 15 and 27.5 years). It is believed to be the longest prospective follow-up to evaluate heart function in children, adolescents and young adults treated with anthracylines.     

The researchers found over a quarter had systolic dysfunction and nearly half had diastolic dysfunction and that this was a further deterioration in heart function compared to an earlier follow-up when fewer than one in ten had systolic dysfunction and less than a fifth had diastolic dysfunction.    

Lead researcher Dr Inge Brouwer, from the subdivision of paediatric oncology at the centre, said: ?We undertook this long-term study because - since it's known that overt  heart failure  has been found in up to 5% of  cancer  survivors treated with anthracyclines - it was possible that subclinical abnormalities might be even more frequent. The natural course of subclinical abnormalities was largely unknown and it was unclear whether we could expect progressive cardiac deterioration.?    

There were 31 long-term survivors in the original group of patients treated between 1977 and 1999. Most were children and adolescents but the age range was 10 to 38. All had cardiac assessment nine years after treatment. Twenty-nine were re-assessed 14 years after treatment, and 22 in the present round of assessment. Of the original group, one died from congestive heart failure; one from a second cancer; two - who were already known to have an abnormal heart function - were excluded because they had received thoracic  radiotherapy  for a second cancer; one had a terminal neurodegenerative disease and four refused to take part.    

In addition to a physical examination and medical history the assessment involved blood tests and  blood pressure  measurements, Doppler echocardiography, a static ECG and 24-hour ECG monitoring during normal activities. Systolic and diastolic function tests showed how well the heart's left chamber was pumping (systolic function) and relaxing (diastolic function).  

Dr Brouwer said: ?We found progressive impairment of systolic and diastolic function. We also found a deterioration in heart rate variability (HRV) in the 19 of the 22 patients whose HRV we were able to evaluate. HRV is the alteration in the beat-to-beat rate of the heart and reduced HRV is a marker for potential heart problems.     

?Forty-five per cent of the 22 long-term survivors, whose median age is now 39, had diastolic dysfunction compared with 18% in 1997 and 27% had systolic dysfunction compared with 9% in 1997. The six patients with impaired systolic function also had abnormalities in the motion of the heart wall with suggestions of ischaemic  heart disease  in two of them. In addition, we knew that three of the nine patients who did not take part in this latest assessment, have or had cardiac dysfunction.?    

She said that other studies involving moderate term follow-up of anthracyline-treated cancer survivors had produced conflicting results with some showing progressive abnormalities, while others showed no further deterioration. ?We also found unchanged systolic function at our moderate term follow-up and now subsequently a further decrease, but our study, although small, has a 22-year median follow-up, which is considerably longer than most others, which have been about 13 years.?    

?Our results suggest that after treatment with anthracyclines there is an ongoing deterioration of cardiac function and it is possible that this deterioration will continue, although we don't know if and when there will be further progression. For this reason regular echocardiography seems important to monitor heart function. Most doxorubicin-treated survivors with cardiac abnormalities that show up on echocardiography have no cardiac complaints. We need to keep checking them and be ready to start medication to stabilise their heart function in order to prevent further cardiac deterioration and development of cardiac complaints. It is important to be ready to treat cardiovascular risk factors - for example,  high blood pressure  or  cholesterol  - and to encourage patients to make helpful lifestyle changes such as stopping smoking, reducing their weight if necessary and taking exercise.?  
Dr Brouwer added that cardiotoxicity from anthracycline treatment is an issue in all cancer survivors that used this treatment, not just bone tumours. Although some studies have found younger people to be more at risk of heart damage, their study has not found young age was a factor. They are to continue their follow-up and expand their ongoing study to include all childhood cancer survivors treated at the University Medical Centre in Groningen.    

But, she concluded by stressing that doxorubicin was a highly effective treatment and the cure of cancer was still the first priority. Patients now also tended to receive lower doses of doxorubicin although there were still some who needed high doses. If there is was a deterioration in heart function during treatment, doses were normally reduced. Furthermore, there were cardioprotective drugs, such as dexrazoxane available now, which were not available to earlier patients.

153,273415,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315531.php,"Feed a cold, starve a fever? Not so fast, according to Salk research",Infectious Diseases / Bacteria / Viruses,Infectious Diseases / Bacteria / Viruses,Nutrition / Diet,,,3,3,1,3,4,4,4,3,4,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,,,,,"
The last time you had a stomach bug, you probably didn't feel much like eating. This loss of appetite is part of your body's normal response to an illness but is not well understood. Sometimes eating less during illness promotes a faster recovery, but other times - such as when cancer patients experience wasting - the loss of appetite can be deadly.

Now, research from the Salk Institute shows how bacteria block the appetite loss response in their host to both make the host healthier and also promote the bacteria's transmission to other hosts. This surprising discovery, published in the journal Cell, reveals a link between appetite and infection and could have implications in treating infectious diseases, infection transmission and appetite loss associated with illness, aging, inflammation or medical interventions (like chemotherapy).

""It's long been known that infections cause loss of appetite but the function of that, if any, is only beginning to be understood,"" says Janelle Ayres, assistant professor at Salk Institute's Nomis Foundation Laboratories for Immunobiology and Microbial Pathogenesis.

Mice orally infected with the bacteria Salmonella Typhimurium typically experience appetite loss and eventually become much sicker as the bacteria become more virulent - spreading from the intestines to other tissues in the body. Ayres' team tested different conditions in the infected mice and found that sick mice that consumed extra calories despite their appetite loss actually survived longer. It turns out this survival wasn't due to a more active immune response by well-fed animals (as measured by levels of the bacteria in the host). Instead, it was because the Salmonella weren't spreading outside of the intestines and throughout the body when the mice ate more, which enabled the animals to stay healthy despite infection. Even more surprising, the Salmonella were acting on the intestine to try to suppress the appetite loss in the host.

The finding was initially puzzling: why would the bacteria become less virulent and not spread to other areas in the body when nutrients were more plentiful? And why would Salmonella actively promote this condition? It turns out the bacteria were making a tradeoff between virulence, which is the ability of a microbe to cause disease within one host, and transmission, which is its ability to spread and establish infections between multiple hosts.

""What we found was that appetite loss makes the Salmonella more virulent, perhaps because it needs to go beyond the intestines to find nutrients for itself. This increased virulence kills its host too fast, which compromises the bacteria's ability to spread to new hosts,"" explains Sheila Rao, a Salk research associate and the first author on the study. ""The tradeoff between transmission and virulence has not been appreciated before - it was previously thought that virulence and transmission were coupled.""

When the host ate more and survived longer during infection, the Salmonella benefitted: bacteria in those mice were able to spread via feces to other animals and increase its transmission between hosts, as compared to bacteria in mice who didn't eat and died sooner due to heightened bacterial virulence.

The researchers discovered that, to halt the appetite-loss response and boost transmission between hosts, Salmonella produces a molecule called SlrP, which blocks activation of an immune protein (cytokine) in the intestines. This cytokine typically communicates with the brain's appetite center, called the hypothalamus, to prompt the host to lose its appetite during infection. The team found that mice infected with Salmonella that couldn't make SlrP ate less food while infected, lost more weight and died faster than control mice.

Though the same gut-brain pathway tied to appetite loss exists in the human as in mice, Ayres cautions that infection responses are dependent on many factors and that whether eating - or fasting - during illness can improve one's health will depend in large part on what the causative agent of the infection is. Her team is planning to search the human microbiome (the collection of bacteria that live in people's bodies) to find other microbes that might have a similar effect on this pathway and explore those for new therapies tied to appetite loss and treating disease. The lab also wants to investigate whether drugs could be used to turn up or down the sickness-induced appetite-loss pathway that SlrP targets.

""Now that we'd identified this mechanism that regulates appetite, we want to turn it on the flip side and see if we can decrease appetite via this mechanism to help in cases of metabolic disease,"" says Ayres.

The discovery also points to the tantalizing possibility of treating infectious diseases with approaches other than antibiotics, such as nutritional intervention. ""Finding alternatives to antibiotics is incredibly important as these drugs have already encouraged the evolution of deadly antibiotic-resistant strains,"" says Ayres. In the United States alone, two million people annually become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics and at least 23,000 people die each year as a direct result of these infections, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.

By studying a little-known yeast too primitive to get diseases, Johns Hopkins researchers have uncovered a surprising 

link between two processes at play in  heart disease  and  cancer  in people.    
In experiments with yeast known as S. pombe, the researchers discovered that a gene that helps the organism make  cholesterol  

also helps it survive when oxygen is scarce. The finding, described in the March 25 issue of Cell, offers a new strategy for 

killing infectious yeast, but it also suggests that cells' efforts to make cholesterol and detect oxygen levels might be 

connected in people, too.    
""We were simply trying to establish that this yeast could be a model for studying cholesterol-related activities in human 

cells,"" says the study's leader, Peter Espenshade, Ph.D., assistant professor of cell biology in Johns Hopkins' Institute for 

Basic Biomedical Sciences. ""We certainly didn't expect to find a completely new role for this gene.""    
It's already well established that human cells can both make cholesterol and sense oxygen. In people, high levels of 

cholesterol in the blood are a major risk factor for heart disease, and many human cancer cells are able to survive despite 

being in tumors' oxygen-starved centers.    
""We don't know yet whether cholesterol production and oxygen sensing are connected in human cells, but now we're trying to 

find out,"" says Espenshade.    
In people, the gene in question, known as SREBP, controls other genes whose products help make or import cholesterol. 

Cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins mimic this gene's natural role by triggering cells to import more cholesterol, 

clearing the artery-clogging stuff from the blood.    
Despite the obvious medical relevance of SREBP, no one had ever looked at the equivalent system -- or even determined whether 

there was one -- in yeast, the simple, single-celled relatives with which we share many genes. Because yeast can be easily 

manipulated and studied, Espenshade figured they might be a good model for figuring out exactly how SREBP is turned on, what 

it does and how it's shut off -- if the organism has an equivalent process.    
Turning first to databases of the entire genetic sequences of various yeast, Espenshade sought yeast genes that looked like 

SREBP and its binding partner SCAP. Nothing turned up in the well-studied S. cerevisiae, or brewer's yeast, but S. pombe 

seemed to have the right stuff.    
Graduate student Adam Hughes then examined the role of these similar genes to prove that they in fact duplicate the human 

process. Indeed, the yeast gene they called sre1 triggered activation of cholesterol-producing genes, aided by a gene called 

scp1 that behaves like SCAP.    
As in humans, sre1 somehow gets turned on when cholesterol levels are low, increasing the cell's production of cholesterol. 

As cholesterol builds up in the cell, sre1 is gradually turned off.    
""Essentially, SREBP and sre1 both try to maintain an optimal level of cholesterol in the cells,"" says Espenshade.    
But, based on what he now knows, Espenshade suspects that the yeast use cholesterol levels to figure out whether there's 

enough oxygen around for biology as usual. Single-celled yeast can alter their biology to live without oxygen, and human 

cells can do so to a certain extent. Johns Hopkins researcher Gregg Semenza, M.D., Ph.D., discovered a number of years ago 

how human cells react to low oxygen levels, but that process has never been connected to cholesterol production.    
""Our cells can adjust to lowered oxygen by turning on a specific set of genes when oxygen levels drop [using a gene called 

HIF1-alpha],"" says Espenshade. ""While there's no known connection between this process and cholesterol production, our 

results in the yeast suggest that perhaps SREBP itself, or something in the cholesterol pathway, might also serve as an 

oxygen sensor for mammalian cells.""    
It makes sense, he says, that the yeast could use its cholesterol levels as an indirect measure of oxygen levels. The cell 

uses a few oxygen molecules each time it makes cholesterol, so lowered cholesterol levels could signal that there's not 

enough oxygen around to make it. And because low cholesterol levels automatically turn on the yeast's version of SREBP, it's 

an easy solution to have the same gene sound the alarm that the cell needs to adapt to low levels of oxygen.    
Espenshade says sre1's role in the yeast's production of cholesterol (actually a similar molecule called ergosterol) and 

sensing of oxygen might offer a new opportunity to kill infectious yeast and fungi that share the gene with S. pombe. 

   
""Without the sre1 gene, the yeast in our experiments died in low oxygen conditions,"" says Espenshade. ""Because low oxygen 

levels are common in infected tissues, if we can block infectious yeasts' SREBP pathway without affecting human cells' 

cholesterol pathways, we might be able to treat certain infections.""    
Espenshade and his team have found that infection-causing yeast Aspergillus, Neurospora, Cryptococcus and Ustilago share S. 

pombe's cholesterol-related genes, while S. cerevisae and the yeast Candida do not.    
The researchers were funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the National Heart, Lung and Blood 

Institute and the Burroughs Wellcome Fund. Authors on the paper are Hughes, Bridget Todd and Espenshade, all of Hopkins.

A study conducted at the University of Eastern Finland revealed that a recently described T cell subset may have a central role in the development of type 1 diabetes. These so called follicular T helper cells were found to be increased at the onset of type 1 diabetes, and the phenomenon was linked with the presence of autoantibodies commonly associated with the disease.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the immune system destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Type 1 diabetes typically manifests in childhood and early adolescence. Diabetes-associated autoantibodies are highly predictive of type 1 diabetes risk and they can be typically detected in the blood of patients even years before the onset of the disease.

T cells are immune cells that have an important role orchestrating the functions of the immune system. Follicular helper T cells are a recently described subset of T cells that have a central role in activating B cells, which in turn are responsible for producing antibodies.

Since the emergence of autoantibodies is a common feature of type 1 diabetes development, it is plausible that follicular T helper cells have a role in the disease process. This notion is also supported by evidence recently generated in the murine model of type 1 diabetes.

In a study led by Academy Research Fellow Tuure Kinnunen, samples from the Finnish DIPP follow-up study were used. In the DIPP study, children with an increased genetic risk for developing type 1 diabetes are longitudinally followed for the development of the disease. In the current study, the frequency of blood follicular T helper cells was observed to increase close to the onset of type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the phenomenon was only observed in a subgroup of children that were positive for multiple diabetes-associated autoantibodies. This finding suggests a connection between the activation of follicular helper T cells and the activation of autoantibody-producing B cells in type 1 diabetes.

Taken together, the current results support the idea that follicular helper T cells have a role in the development of type 1 diabetes. Immune therapies that target these cells can therefore be envisioned to have potential in the prevention of type 1 diabetes.

The study also involved researchers from the Universities of Turku, Helsinki, Tampere and Oulu.

Employees subjected to real or threatened violence at work run a major risk of becoming clinically depressed, indicates research in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.
   
The magnitude of the risk was in direct proportion to the amount of workplace violence experienced, the study shows.
   
The findings are based on the occupations of more than 14,000 hospital patients between the ages of 18 and 65, who were being treated for  depression  or  stress  related disorders between 1995 and 1998.
   
These patients were then compared with 38, 000 people without mental ill health problems, but matched for age and sex. All participants were asked about their jobs and if they had been subjected to violence at work in the previous 12 months.
   
The prevalence of real and threatened violence was highest among those working in health, education, and social work sectors. Male employees were at greater risk of violence than women.
   
While most violence came from clients, patients, and pupils, around 5% of study participants with  mental health  problems said they were subjected to violent behaviour from their work colleagues.
   
Almost half said they had been subjected to more than one incident of violence or threatening behaviour in the preceding 12 months, and one in five said they had been subjected to both.
   
Exposure to violence boosted the risk of depression by 45% in women and 48% in men, compared with those in workplaces without any risk of violence.
   
Stress related disorders were around a third more likely in women and 55% more likely in men.
   
Threatening behaviour boosted the likelihood of depression by 48% in women and stress related disorders by almost 60% in men.
   
The magnitude of risk was directly proportional to the amount of violence experienced at work.
   
The authors say that other research suggests that being subjected to violence may over stimulate the autonomic nervous system, which then translates into an emotional disorder, even among those with stable personality traits.
   
The risk of psychiatric problems among employees exposed to violence is well recognised and reflected in guidance from the European Commission and the International Labour Organisation, they add.
   
\""Despite these efforts, there seems to be no decrease in work related violence, threats, and harassment,\"" they conclude.

Two-thirds of parents fear social media is bad for their child, yet they use it extensively themselves.

That is the conclusion of research by Dr Judith Ramsay from Manchester Metropolitan University and Dr Melody Terras and Fozia Yousaf from the University of the West of Scotland being presented today, Thursday 28 April 2016, to the annual conference of the British Psychological Society in Nottingham.

The researchers asked 107 parents of children aged five and above to complete a questionnaire examining the amount of time they spend using technology, watching television, listening to music and social networking, as well as their preferences and motivations for using technology.

The questionnaire also asked about their child's technology use and the impact of the use of technology on the parent-child relationship.

The results showed that parents engaged in a wide range of activities - watching television, gaming, mobile phone use and social media - and reported that their children engaged in a similar range. Two-thirds of parents reported using digital media to gain information, while acknowledging that information gained in this way is not always accurate.

A close relationship was found between how much parents watched television, read, played video games, used social networking sites, used their mobile phone and listened to music and how much their time children spent on the same activities.

Yet two-thirds of parents expressed the view that social media was harmful for their child.

Dr Judith Ramsay said: ""Our findings suggest parents are worried about their children's use of technology, which makes it interesting that their own use of it is has so much influence on their children.

""We need to raise parental awareness of the strong effect they have and this influence must also be taken into account by professionals developing policies that promote safe use of the internet for children.""",0

Researchers in Pennsylvania and Iowa have discovered that fungal communities found in chronic wounds can form mixed bacterial-fungal biofilms and can be associated with poor outcomes and longer healing times. Their report, the first deep characterization of the fungi found in diabetic foot ulcers, is published this week in mBio, an online open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology.

The team followed 100 patients with diabetic foot ulcers - open wounds located on the bottom of the foot - during the course of 26 weeks, or until the wound healed or required amputation. Their findings highlight that fungal components of the microbiome can play a major role in hampering the healing of chronic wounds.

""Chronic wounds are a silent epidemic,"" says Elizabeth Grice, assistant professor of dermatology and microbiology at University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and senior author on the study. ""They usually occur in conjunction with another disorder such as diabetes or obesity, but once a chronic wound occurs, it requires a lot of healthcare and has a devastating effect on a patient's quality of life.""

The American Diabetes Association estimates that more than 7 million diabetics in the US will have a diabetic foot ulcer in their lifetime and 15 percent will end up with a lower limb amputation. Healthcare for chronic wounds in the US costs tens of billions of dollars each year.

Grice and postdoctoral researcher Lindsay Kalan wanted to know which fungal species make up the communities thriving deep inside a chronic wound and what roles they might play in impaired healing. This represents a ""huge missing piece"" of chronic wound research, says Grice.

All of the ulcer patients were given the same medical care. A team led by Sue Gardner, professor of nursing at University of Iowa, sampled patients' deep wound fluid every two weeks. Those samples were sent to Grice and Kalan for genetic sequencing and identification of the fungi residing in the wounds.

The team found that 80 percent of the wounds harbored fungi - much higher than previous estimates - from 284 different species. The most abundant fungus, Cladosporium herbarum, was found in 41percent of the samples and the human pathogen Candida albicans was next most abundant, in a little over one-fifth of the samples.

No single species of fungi was associated with poor outcomes, but rather mixed communities were associated with slow healing or complications such as bone infection and amputation. However, higher levels of ascomycetes, or sac fungi, at the initial swabbing were associated with wounds that took longer than 8 weeks to heal.  This hints that, in the future, doctors might be able to swab wounds to get a quick prediction of the time to heal.

Kalan looked at two patients' wounds more closely to determine if their stable communities of microbes could grow biofilms, which are thought to keep many chronic wounds festering.

She isolated the C. albicans yeast and Citrobacter freundii bacteria from a patient whose wound eventually healed and she isolated the fungus Trichosporon asahii and bacteria Staphylococcus simulans from a patient whose wound resulted in an amputation.  When she co-cultured these bacterial-fungal pairs in the laboratory, she found that both pairs formed a mixed biofilm.

""Lindsay showed very nicely that the fungi interact with the bacteria, potentially making biofilms within wounds,"" says Grice. ""You can't properly target treatment if you are missing that critical interaction.""

Kalan says the study is a first step toward better understanding chronic wounds and develop better ways to treat them: ""There are polymicrobial interactions within these wounds. It's important to look at the fungal and bacterial communities and how they interact with each other and the immune system to impair or promote healing.""

Physicians should screen mothers for  postpartum depression  regularly for at least a year following childbirth to better identify women who develop symptoms throughout the year and those whose  depression  persists, University of Rochester Medical Center researchers say.
   
\""If you only screen early or if you only screen once, you will miss some,\"" said Linda Chaudron, M.D., an assistant professor of psychiatry, pediatrics and obstetrics and gynecology at the Medical Center who is leading a series of studies focusing on postpartum depression.
   
In a recent analysis of records from a pediatric clinic that uses a common postpartum questionnaire to screen mothers, Chaudron and the research group found that of women who scored high on a depression screening scale sometime in the postpartum year, 26 percent did not develop high symptom levels of postpartum depression until after three months and that 33 percent had high levels throughout the year. The results of the study are published in the July/August issue of the journal Ambulatory Pediatrics.
   
\""I was surprised at the high percentage of women who continued to be depressed throughout the year,\"" Chaudron said.
   
Earlier this year, New Jersey Governor Jon S. Corzine signed legislation requiring health care professionals providing postnatal care to screen new mothers for postpartum depression, and requiring health care professionals to educate women and their families about the disorder. Health care providers in several other states have adopted similar screening programs.
   
\""With the increased attention to screening, we ought to have a better idea about when to screen,\"" Chaudron said. \""There are a lot more women we need to be thinking about, identifying and helping get treatment.\""
   
Pediatricians and other physicians who refer mothers for treatment of depression also can help track how mothers are doing, even if they are in treatment.
   
\""They should find out how the mother is doing and whether she is receiving the proper treatment,\"" Chaudron said.
   
The study reported in Ambulatory Pediatrics was limited. The records covered only 49 mothers. But Chaudron said the report highlighted that women can develop new symptoms later in the year and can continue to have symptoms for many months.
   
According to the American Psychiatric Association, symptoms of postpartum depression include sadness, sluggishness,  fatigue , feelings of hopelessness, disturbances of sleep or appetite, lack of interest in the baby, uncontrollable crying, mood swings and fear of harming the baby. Many mothers also report significant  anxiety . Postpartum depression is different from \""baby blues,\"" a mild, short-lived depression that many women experience in the first few days or weeks following childbirth. Postpartum depression affects one in eight women and lasts more than two weeks. It can interfere with daily living for a longer period of time.
   
Medication and talk therapy are effective treatments for postpartum depression. \""Support groups also can decrease the isolation and stigma that depressed mothers can feel,\"" Chaudron said.
   
Understanding postpartum depression is critical to improving care for mothers and infants. Chaudron and her colleagues currently are conducting a variety of studies, including looking at the course of postpartum depression, exploring the relationship between postpartum depression and anxiety, and investigating the use of an  antidepressant  for the treatment of postpartum depression.

Women with no history of  depression  may be at an increased risk of new onset depressive symptoms and disorders as they transition to  menopause , according to two studies in the April issue of Archives of General Psychiatry, one of the JAMA/Archives journals.
   
As background information in the articles, the authors write that although the transition to menopause has long been considered a time of increased risk for developing depressive symptoms, there is little scientific evidence to connect the change in reproductive hormones, menopausal status and  mental health .
   
Ellen W. Freeman, Ph.D., from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, and colleagues evaluated data from 231 premenopausal women who had no history of depression at the start of the study. The participants ranged in age from 35 to 47 and were followed for eight years. At set intervals, blood samples were obtained to determine hormone levels and trained research interviewers obtained overall health and demographic information, including any menopausal symptoms experienced. Depressive symptoms were assessed by using the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression scale (CES-D), and the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) was used to identify clinical diagnoses of depressive disorders.
   
""High CES-D scores were more than four times more likely to occur during a woman's menopausal transition compared with when she was premenopausal,"" the authors report. Changes in hormonal levels were significantly associated with high CES-D scores after adjusting for smoking, body mass index, premenstrual syndrome, hot flashes, poor sleep, health status, employment and marital status. According to the authors, ""a diagnosis of depressive disorder was two-and-a-half times more likely to occur in the menopausal transition compared with when the woman was premenopausal; the hormone measures were also significantly associated with this outcome.""
   
""In summary, our data indicate that transition to menopause and its changing hormonal milieu are strongly associated with both new onset of high depressive symptoms and new onset of diagnosed depressive disorders in women with no history of depression. Further follow-up study is needed to determine the extent to which these reports of depressed mood are limited to the perimenopausal period and to determine whether the identified risk factors are associated with more persistent depression,"" the authors conclude.

Early Transition to Menopause May Increase Risk for First Onset of Depression
   
In a related study, Lee S. Cohen, M.D., from Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, and colleagues from the Harvard Study of Moods and Cycles examined the association between the menopausal transition and onset of first lifetime episode of depression among women with no history of mood disturbance. The Harvard Study of Moods and Cycles is a study of premenopausal women with and without a lifetime history of major depression.
   
The participants in this research were 460 premenopausal women, 36 to 45 years of age, with no lifetime diagnosis of major depression, residing in seven Boston area communities. The incidence of new onset of depression was based on structured clinical interviews, CES-D scores, and self-administered questionnaires.
   
""Premenopausal women with no lifetime history of major depression who entered the perimenopause were twice as likely to develop significant depressive symptoms as women who remained premenopausal, after adjustment for age at study enrollment and history of negative life events,"" the researchers found. ""The increased risk for depression was somewhat greater in women with self-reported vasomotor symptoms (for example, hot flashes).""
   
""The current study suggests that within a similarly aged population of women with no lifetime history of depression, those who enter the menopausal transition earlier have a significant risk for first onset of depression,"" the authors state. ""In the United States only, approximately 1.5 million women may reach menopause each year. A spectrum of symptoms and syndromes has been extensively described in women during the menopausal transition including severe vasomotor symptoms, loss of bone density, sexual dysfunction, a decline in cognitive function, and a potential increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Thus, the comorbidity of these problems with perimenopause-associated depression could affect many aging women, leading to a compounded burden of illness,"" the authors conclude.

Researchers from the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center have found that  ginger  not only kills  cancer  cells, it also prevents them from building up resistance to cancer treatment.  Ginger is already used as an effective remedy for nausea and  inflammation .    

The scientists are presenting their results in a poster session at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting.    

In this study, scientists applied a solution of ginger powder and water to  ovarian cancer  cells (similar ginger powder to what is sold at grocery stores, only a standardized research grade).  In every single one of their tests they found that the cancer cells died as a result of being in contact with the ginger solution - they either committed suicide (apoptosis) or they digested/attacked themselves (autophagy).    

If ginger can cause autophagy as well as apoptosis, it can prevent resistance to  chemotherapy  - something that is a common development with ovarian cancer patients.    

Whether or not this brings the same encouraging results in animal studies remains to be seen, say the researchers.    

Another great advantage of ginger is that there are hardly any reports of side effects.  It is also an easy product to present in capsule form.    

The researchers stressed that this is a preliminary study and further research is needed.    


Over 20,000 American women are expected to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year.  15,000 women are expected to die from ovarian cancer this year (in the USA).

Sun worshippers may be increasing their risk of developing  skin cancer  by using sunscreens that encourage them to stay too long in the glare, researchers say.
   
 Sunburn  has long been regarded as an important cause of  melanoma , the most serious form of skin cancer, especially in children under 15. But some experts argue that the real risk comes from spending too long in the sun, and that using sun creams to protect against sunburn may instead promote the  cancer .
   
More than 5,000 cases of melanoma are reported each year in the UK and more than 1,600 deaths. The incidence of the disease has trebled in recent decades, which is thought to be linked with the growing popularity of foreign holidays.
   
Sunscreens have been heavily promoted as a means of protecting sunbathers but they may have the opposite effect, according to a report in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.    It cites Antony Young of King's College, London, who said several large scale studies over the past few years had been 'unable to tease out any clear relationship' between sunscreen use and melanoma incidence. But some studies showed sunscreens increased the incidence of melanoma.
   
Research by Philippe Autier of the European Institute of Oncology in Milan suggests melanoma may be at least a two- stage process, with different kinds of solar radiation causing new moles in childhood and their growth into larger moles that later become cancerous.
   
Over the past decade, he has become convinced that sunburn is 'probably not part of the mechanism of cancer'. It may simply be a marker of people with sensitive skins who are more prone to skin cancer and who have spent too long in the sun. Sunburn may even protect against melanoma - by keeping people out of the sun.
   
Lying in the sun longer, especially at midday when the ultraviolet rays are strongest, may raise a person's exposure above what it would have been without sunscreen. It is this intense, intentional time in the sun that is most closely linked with melanoma risk, Dr Autier said.
   
The only way to reduce the risk of melanoma may be to hide from the sun in the shade, cover up with a hat and long-sleeved shirt, or stay indoors. ",0

Our gut microbiota contains at least 1,000 different species of known bacteria, summing up 3 million genes.

We share one third of our gut bacteria with other people, while the composition in our other two thirds is unique to each one of us.  


Gut microbiota is important to our health because it contributes to a healthy immune system by acting as a barrier against other harmful microorganisms.It also helps with digesting foods that the stomach and small intestine have not been able to digest, as well as producing some vitamins. 


We have always been told by healthcare professionals and nutritionists that fiber is important to a healthy diet.But new research examines exactly what happens if our intestinal microbes do not receive the appropriate amount of fiber.  

The study was carried out by an international team of researchers led by Eric Martens, Ph.D., associate professor of microbiology at the University of Michigan Medical School, and Mahesh Desai, Ph.D., from the Luxembourg Institute of Health.


Researchers bred mice especially for the study. Mice were born and raised without any gut bacteria of their own. They then received a transplant of 14 bacteria that normally live in the human gut. 


Knowing the genetic signature of each bacterium, scientists were able to track the evolution of each one of them over time. They used a germ-free lab facility and genetic techniques that allowed them to see what bacteria were present and active under different dietary conditions.


Researchers infected the mice with a strain of bacteria that is the equivalent of E. coli in humans. Then they examined the impact of diets with varying amounts of fiber, as well as a diet with no fiber at all. 


Researchers tried a diet that was 15 percent fiber, made from minimally-processed grains and plants. They also tried a diet that was rich in prebiotic fiber - a purified form of soluble fiber that is similar to what some processed foods and dietary supplements contain. 

As revealed by the study - published in the journal Cell - the induced infection did not fully spread in mice that received the 15 percent-fiber diet. Their mucus layer remained thick, protecting them against the infection. 


But when scientists replaced the diet with one that lacked fiber altogether, gut microbes started eating the mucus. Even a few days of fiber deprivation led the bacteria to start invading the colon wall. 

Gut microbes rely on fiber for their food, and when they do not get it, they start eating away at your gut. This makes the gut more prone to infections.

The diet rich in supplement-like prebiotic fiber had the same results as the diet lacking fiber completely. The mucus layer started eroding as a result of the action of microbes.


""The lesson we're learning from studying the interaction of fiber, gut microbes and the intestinal barrier system is that if you don't feed them, they can eat you.""Eric Martens, Ph.D.
Researchers were also able to see what fiber-digesting enzymes the bacteria were making. They found 1,600 different enzymes that digest carbohydrates - a complexity similar to the one found in the human gut. 


A lack of fiber also triggered a higher production of such mucus-degrading enzymes.   


Scientists were able to look at images of the ""goblet"" cells on the colon wall that produce mucus. They could clearly see how the mucus layer got progressively thinner as the mice received less fiber. 

In a normal gut, mucus is being produced and degraded at a steady pace. But on a fiber-deprived diet, mucus was degraded at a much higher pace than it was produced. 

Examining the gut tissue of infected mice, researchers were able to see inflammation across a wide area of thinning, and even patchy tissue.     


Infected mice that received a diet rich in fiber also displayed inflammation but across a much smaller area. 

In the future, Martens and Desai hope to study the effect of different prebiotic combinations over a longer period of time, as well as the impact of an intermittent natural fiber diet. 


Researchers would also like to find the biomarkers that signal the state of the mucus layer in human guts, such as the number of mucus-degrading bacteria. 


Martens and Desai also wish to study the impact of a low-fiber diet on chronic illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease. 
""While this work was in mice, the take-home message for humans amplifies everything that doctors and nutritionists have been telling us for decades: Eat a lot of fiber from diverse natural sources.

Your diet directly influences your microbiota, and from there it may influence the status of your gut's mucus layer and tendency toward disease. But it's an open question of whether we can cure our cultural lack of fiber with something more purified and easy to ingest than a lot of broccoli.""

RICHLAND, Wash. - A new method of extracting and analyzing fluid from a woman's breast may provide a more accurate, less expensive and noninvasive way to determine a patient's risk for  breast cancer  or to diagnose the disease in its early stages.   

In a paper published in the July 3 issue of Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, Battelle scientists at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and researchers at University of California, Los Angeles report they have discovered six times more proteins than previously identified in this fluid, called nipple aspirate fluid, or NAF.   

The presence of such proteins suggests that NAF could be a resource for biomarkers, or biological indicators, of breast cancer, which is expected to claim the lives of approximately 40,000 American women this year. 
   
'We believe this fluid could be the best alternative for discovering biomarkers for early-stage breast cancer,' said Rick Zangar, a Battelle principal investigator at PNNL.    'With further analysis, we could detect up to 10 times more proteins in NAF. The more proteins we identify, the better chance there is to find one that is linked to breast cancer.' 
   
Proteins can serve as biomarkers of disease. When cancerous cells begin to develop, they create their own proteins that, if detected in NAF, could indicate the presence or risk of breast cancer. Current methods for screening include breast self-exams and mammograms, which are physical exams compared with the molecular approach at PNNL. 
   
NAF is continuously secreted and reabsorbed in breasts of women who aren't pregnant or lactating. It is generated from cells lining the ducts that form a network throughout the breast, the same network that provides milk in a lactating woman. These ductal cells are the source of 70 to 80 percent of breast cancer. 
   
'NAF offers a unique window through which we can monitor the processes occurring inside the breast ductal system,' Zangar said. 'The medical community recognizes that one way to markedly decrease mortality from breast cancer would be a more accurate, noninvasive method for early diagnosis. Our approach suggests there could be other options available.' 
   
The NAF samples were collected using an enhanced process that is less painful than other extraction methods yet obtains just as much fluid. It was developed by co-author Chandice Covington, Professor and Chair, Primary Care Nursing at UCLA School of Nursing. 
   
While NAF has been studied for more than 25 years, most extraction methods have been painful. Through Covington's process, women use warmth, massage and a simple breast pump that eases the fluid from the breast without discomfort. 
   
'Women need early mechanisms for detecting potential or existing disease,' Covington said. 'Current detection methods rely on feeling a lump in a self-exam or visualizing a lump in a mammogram. By the time a lump has formed, the  cancer  has progressed. My technique, combined with Battelle's protein analysis capabilities, makes our approach one of the leading methods for identifying biomarkers for breast cancer in the early stages, before a lump is detectable.' 
   
Zangar and colleague Susan Varnum analyzed the NAF samples using high-throughput mass spectrometers located in the William R. Wiley Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, a DOE national user facility located at PNNL. Of the 65 proteins identified, 15 of them, or 23 percent, have been previously implicated as potential biomarkers for breast cancer.    This implies that NAF provides a useful sample for analysis of known breast cancer biomarkers, while offering the possibility of providing novel biomarkers not yet identified in blood samples. 
   
The results are promising, but Zangar also noted there are more questions that need to be addressed. 
   
'Will a biomarker show up sooner in NAF than in blood? We don't know yet, but we do know that NAF is a concentrated source of proteins specifically released by breast cells. A marker protein released into the blood, on the other hand, is more diluted, and it's more difficult to determine where in the body the protein came from,' he said. 
   
Zangar and his team hope to secure additional funding to further study the proteins identified in NAF using a protein microarray they developed that can screen dozens of proteins simultaneously. 
   
The Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program funded the majority of the NAF research. Business inquiries on this or other areas of research at PNNL should be directed to 888-375-PNNL or inquiry@pnl.gov.

Treating certain  lung cancer  patients with surgery followed by  radiation therapy  can improve their chances of long-term survival, according to a study of more than 7,000 patients. The results, which suggest the need to reconsider radiation therapy's role in treatment, are reported today in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. 
   
""Post-operative radiation therapy has failed to demonstrate a survival benefit in the past, likely because previous studies used older equipment,"" said Brian Lally, M.D., a radiation oncologist at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center and lead author. ""Our study, which examines the results using modern equipment, shows survival benefit in select patients."" 
   
The study analyzed data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Database (SEER), a national program that collects information on  cancer  cases from registries that represent 26 percent of the U.S. population. Lally began the research at Yale University School of Medicine before he joined Wake Forest Baptist. 
   
The analysis found that in patients whose disease had spread to the regional lymph nodes between the lungs, overall survival at five years was 27 percent in patients receiving surgery plus radiation therapy, compared to 20 percent in patients who were treated with surgery alone. 
   
""Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in this country and even with the best therapy, survival is poor; so an increase of this level can be considered significant,"" said Lally. ""I speculate that the improvement in the technology available to deliver radiation therapy is responsible for this increase.""
   
In the past, the combination of surgery/radiation therapy was the standard of care for lung cancer. However, this practice shifted dramatically after an analysis of nine studies found that radiation therapy had a detrimental effect on survival. Today, most lung cancer patients are treated with surgery and  chemotherapy  and less than one-third receive radiation therapy.
   
Many of the patients in the older studies were treated with cobalt-60 radiation therapy and the side effects could include damage to heart and lung tissue. Today, most hospitals offer therapy with linear accelerators - a more precise treatment. 
   
The goal of Lally's research was to determine if the advances in radiation therapy technology would result in improved survival. Researchers analyzed results of 7,465 patients who had surgery for lung cancer. About half (47 percent) received radiation therapy after the surgery and 53 percent didn't. 
   
In all patients, Lally and colleagues found that radiation treatment did not impact survival. However, when patients were compared based on lymph node involvement, there were clear differences. In patients where cancer had spread to high-risk regional lymph nodes, survival was improved with radiation therapy. 
   
""For the patients who received surgery and radiation therapy, their survival was better than patients who received surgery alone,"" said Lally.
   
Lally said the study, which followed patients for 3.5 years, has limitations because the researchers didn't have information on some variables that might influenced the results, such as whether the patients had microscopic disease that may have been left behind after surgery. He said additional studies are needed to assess the role of radiation therapy and the emerging technology in treatment. 
   
He also said that researchers need to continue to work to investigate the improving technology in hopes that all patients can gain benefit. Today, radiation oncologists are using CT-PET (computed tomography/positron emission tomography) and  MRI  (magnetic resonance imaging), to better visualize tumors and target them with radiation. Intensity modulated radiation therapy, another new technology, is able to control the radiation beam to deliver precise doses to specific areas within a  tumor .
   
""We are becoming very precise with delivering the radiation to the tumor and reducing the risk of damage to surrounding tissue,"" he said.

Japanese American men respond better to hormonal treatment for  prostate cancer  and have a much higher survival rate than white American men, according to research published in the latest issue of the UK-based urology journal BJU International.     

A team of researchers from the US and Japan compared 59 white males and 105 Japanese American males who had receive hormone treatment for prostate cancer at The Queen's Medical Centre in Honolulu, Hawaii.    

They discovered that, although there was little difference between the patients' backgrounds and ages, five years after the treatment started the overall survival rate for the Japanese American patients was 66 per cent, compared with 42 per cent for the white men in the sample.    

The result between the two ethnic groups did not appear to be affected by whether the men's  cancer  was confined to the prostate or had spread to other parts of the body.    

However the survival rates tended to even out in the most advanced cancers, when the levels of the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) protein produced by the prostate exceeded 100. About a quarter of the study sample had PSA readings in this range.    

?Japanese men have one of the lowest rates of prostate cancer worldwide, but levels tend to be higher among Japanese American men, compared with those who actually live in Japan? says lead author Dr Takashi Fukagai, a urologist at the Showa University School of Medicine in Tokyo.     

?One theory is that Japanese Americans retain some native Japanese genetic and,or,lifestyle characteristics that lead to them developing prostate cancer less frequently than white American men.    

?We also have a ongoing study of other ethnic groups, which has shown that Chinese men living in Hawaii have a similar prognosis to Japanese American men. We have also discovered that Filipino men have a worse prognosis than those two ethnic groups, but still enjoy a higher survival rate than white men.    

The men who took part in the study had an average age of 76 and had all received hormonal treatment from the same team or urologists. Hormone therapy blocks the action of the male sex hormones that help the cancer cells grow, either through administering  testosterone  lowering drugs or by removing the testosterone-producing testicles.    

None of the study subjects had received definitive surgical or  radiation therapy .    

Five factors were examined in detail - age, race, pre-treatment PSA score, the clinical stage that the cancer had reached and the Gleason score, which defines the severity of the cancer based on microscopic analysis.    

Only two factors - race and the pre-treatment PSA score - were shown to have a significant effect on whether the patient survived and for how long.    

?One of the reasons why the survival rate may be better among Japanese American men with a PSA of less than 100 is that they are less likely to suffer from the side-effects of the hormone treatment, such as heart problems, compared with white American males? adds Dr Fukagai.    ?



?There is also evidence that different races have different genetic profiles. As prostate cancer is a disease that is affected by hormones, it may be that the nature of the actual disease, and how it progresses, varies between different races.    

?However prostate cancer undergoes various changes as it develops and we suspect that the changes that take place in the advanced stages of the disease reduce the effect of those ethnic differences.    

?This would account for the fact that there was a difference in survival rates between Japanese American and white men with a PSA of less than 100, but those ethnic differences disappeared in more severe cases with a PSA of more than 100.?

Previous research has indicated that music training when young can improve infants' ability to process musical sounds and speech.

However, it has not been clear from these studies whether perceptual differences between musicians and non-musicians are due to music training. It may be that people who already have superior auditory skills are more likely to become involved in musical activities.

In addition, the quality and style of music training vary widely, potentially affecting the results.

Researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle have investigated the effects of early music training on music and speech processing in 9-month-old infants.

The participants were all from monolingual, English-speaking backgrounds and their previous exposure to music were similar. None of their parents were musicians.

The randomized, controlled study involved one group of 20 infants listening to recordings of music in triple meter (waltz time), while a control group of 19 infants played with non-musical toys.

Fast facts about music

The children participated in 12 sessions, each lasting 15 minutes, over a period of 4 weeks.

Activities in both groups were multimodal, social, and repetitive - experiences typically found in infant music classes, except that the control group's experience did not involve music.

Infants in the music intervention group were encouraged and helped to tap out the musical beats with maracas or their feet, and they were bounced in time with the rhythms.

Those in the control group played with cars, blocks and other toys that required coordinated movement but not music.

After the 4-week study period, the team used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure neural responses in the infants.

MEG is a non-invasive technique for investigating the dynamic, magnetic fields that result from synchronized neural firing. It can provide millisecond-by-millisecond measurements of ongoing brain activity. It also reveals which part of the brain activity is occurring in.

During the MEG recordings, the infants heard tones in triple meter and sounds from foreign languages.

On hearing both music and speech sounds, those who had received music training displayed greater neural activity in auditory and prefrontal cortical regions, which have been associated with pattern processing and the predictive coding of auditory stimuli.

The authors believe that exposure to music early in life might improve infants' ability to detect patterns in complex sounds, and that music intervention can be generalized to changes related to speech development.
Medical News Today asked study co-author Dr. Patricia Kuhl how active children should be to benefit from exposure to music. 

She explained that action is important for learning both music and language. In previous studies, her team has found that when infants listen to people talking, the brain centers they use to talk back are active, even before they are able to talk.

""Infants want to act on the world,"" she said. ""They want to talk back, they want to move to the music, and they
want to make music themselves.""
 
The researchers think that having the children move to the beat of the music was an important part of the intervention's success.

We also asked Dr. Kuhl whether the type of music would make a difference. She told us: 
""All music involves patterns, so the effects we see in the baby brain could hold true for all music. We think infants in the music group learned to detect patterns and that pattern perception is really important for learning, not only in music but broadly. 

We show that the effects of music extended to speech. We don't know if music learning would extend to visual patterns or other patterns, but it might. Learning to predict patterns is a very important skill that could aid learning very generally.""
Dr. Kuhl told MNT that they do not yet know whether older children might benefit from music in the same way, but they plan to test children of different ages in the future.

If you are watching what you eat, working out, and still not seeing improvements in your cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, etc., here's some hope. A new report appearing in the August 2015 issue of The FASEB Journal suggests that inflammation induced by deficiencies in vitamins and minerals might be the culprit. In this report, researchers show that - in some people - improvement results in many of the major markers of health when nutritional deficiencies are corrected. Some even lost weight without a change in their diet or levels of activity.

""It is well known that habitual consumption of poor diets means increased risk of future disease, but clearly this is not a compelling enough reason for many to improve their eating habits,"" said Bruce Ames, Ph.D., a senior scientist at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, director of their Nutrition and Metabolism Center, and a professor emeritus of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. ""However, a relatively easy intervention with something like the nutrient bar used in this study may help people to realize the positive impact that a diet with adequate nutrition can have in their daily lives, which may be a stronger incentive for change.""

To make their Ames and colleagues undertook three clinical trials in which adults ate two nutrient bars each day for two months. Participants acted as their own controls, meaning that changes in a wide variety of biochemical (e.g., HDL-c, LDL-c, insulin) and physical (e.g., blood pressure, weight) measurements were recorded in each individual over the two-month period. People who were overweight/obese moved in a healthier metabolic direction (e.g., improved HDL, LDL, insulin, glucose, etc.), and some lost weight by just eating small, low-calorie, nutrient bars each day for two months, without any additional requirements.

""If being healthy was as simple as 'losing weight' or 'keeping thin,' our ancient ancestors who lived in times of extreme food scarcity might still be with us today,"" said Gerald Weissmann, M.D., Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal. ""This report shows that what you eat is as important, if not more, than how much you eat and how many calories you burn in the gym.""

The ARC Centre of Excellence for Integrative Legume Research (CILR) has lodged a complete patent application for compounds to treat  cancer .
   
CILR researchers screened legumes (plants which obtain useable nitrogen from soil bacteria in their roots) for biological activity and they identified a number of compounds which could potentially prevent the formation of a blood supply to tumours. Without an adequate blood supply tumours stop growing and ultimately can regress.
   
The research has attracted major international interest for intensive collaboration and joint development.
   
The discovery has resulted in a formal research collaboration which is currently underway with French \""CSIRO-equivalent\"" Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. Co-investment discussions are also in progress with a New Zealand company.
   
The CILR formed a commercialisation business \""Meristomics\"" last October to commercialise plant research discoveries. CILR\'s partner universities (the University of Queensland, Australian National University, University of Newcastle and University of Melbourne) passed on their commercialisation rights to Uniquest Pty Ltd, the University of Queensland\'s main commercialisation company.
   
Meristomics Chief Executive Officer Ian Harris said successful completion of this patent demonstrated that Meristomics was an effective model for commercialisation involving multiple partner universities.
   
\""Through UniQuest, Meristomics had immediate access to substantial commercial expertise and is looking to build on its patent success by attracting further funding to progress the research,\"" Mr Harris said.
   
The anti-cancer molecules are produced by legumes during the early symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria known as rhizobia. Rhizobia induce legumes to form tiny new root organs called \""root nodules.\"" The bacteria live in the nodules and provide the plant with useable nitrogen it can convert into proteins.
   
CILR Chief Investigator Professor Chris Parish\'s group, based at ANU\'s John Curtin School of Medical Research, developed the bioassay used to identify the compounds as potential therapeutic agents.
   
\""We have identified several compounds derived from the legume interaction with rhizobium bacteria that show strong anti-angiogenic activity.
   
\""They are promising therapeutic molecules which clearly warrant further investigation,\"" Professor Parish said.
   
CILR Director Professor Peter Gresshoff said the current research success highlighted the importance of a critical mass of multidisciplinary biological scientists working together.
   
\""The CILR was formed in 2003 through the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centres of Excellence scheme to create the scale and focus required to build on existing research strengths through collaboration, and to be internationally competitive.
   
\""ARC core funding and major support through Queensland Government Smart State research funding has been vital in building capacity. It has enabled this marvellous research outcome,\"" Professor Gresshoff said.

170,273791,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315911.php,Researcher investigates why mothers sing to their babies,Pediatrics / Children's Health,Pediatrics / Children's Health,Psychology / Psychiatry,,,4,2,3,5,3,4,4,4,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,,,,,"
Singing to babies is something that happens across most cultures and has, quite possibly, been happening for thousands of years. But why?

This is a difficult question to answer, but Shannon de l'Etoile, professor of music therapy at the University of Miami Frost School of Music, FL, has set out to investigate.

Although the impact of music on the developing brain is not fully understood, according to de l'Etoile: ""We know from previous research that infants have the innate ability to process music in a sophisticated manner.""

We also know that a mother's song to her infant has characteristics that set it apart from other types of singing. For instance, it has a high starting pitch and increased gliding between pitch levels. A mother's song also has sustained vowel sounds and a variety in amplitude not heard in general singing.

Initially, de l'Etoile set out to compare mother's singing to their babies with other types of interactions. 

""I set out to identify infant behaviors in response to live infant-directed singing compared to other common maternal interactions such as reading books and playing with toys. One of the main goals of the research was to clarify the meaning of infant-directed singing as a human behavior and as a means to elicit unique behavioral responses from infants.""

Her study also aimed to investigate the role of infant-directed singing in developing the bond between a mother and her child.

To begin, the researcher filmed 70 infants' responses to six different types of interaction:

This investigation found that singing was just as effective as reading a book or playing with a toy at maintaining infant attention. Additionally, singing held the infant's attention much better than recorded music.

The next step was to study the mother's role during the interaction; as de l'Etoile asks, ""what did the infant engagement tell us about the mother's role during the interaction?""

To this end, the researcher continued her observations, now including the makeup of the mother's song - its ebbs and flows, its intonation and tonal content. Analyzing the song uncovered a sensitivity in the performance:
""Findings revealed that when infants were engaged during song, their mother's instincts are also on high alert. Intuitively, when infant engagement declined, the mother adjusted her pitch, tempo, or key to stimulate and regulate infant response.""Shannon de l'Etoile
To further understand the mother's ability to change the flow of her song sensitively, the researcher investigated differences when a mother with postpartum depression sang to her infant. 

The results, published in the journal Arts in Psychotherapy, showed that this previously noted sensitivity was reduced. De l'Etoile concluded: 

""The extraction and analysis of vocal data revealed that mothers with postpartum depression may lack sensitivity and emotional expression in their singing. Although the infants were still engaged during the interaction, the tempo did not change and was somewhat robotic.""

She believes that infant-directed singing for mothers with postpartum depression offers a unique two-way interaction. Both mother and child can benefit; the infant receives the stimulation they crave that helps to focus their attention, and the mothers are distracted from the negativity of the emotions associated with depression.

Overall, de l'Etoile sees infant-directed songs as an important interaction between a mother and her child. 

""Mothers around the world sing to their infants in remarkably similar ways, and infants prefer these specialized songs,"" she says. ""The tempo and key certainly don't need to be perfect or professional for mothers and infants to interact through song. In fact, infants may be drawn to the personalized tempo and pitch of their mother, which encourage them to direct their gaze toward [her] and ultimately communicate through this gaze.""

As research continues, the interactions between mother and child and the importance of each modality will become clearer. For now, mothers can be encouraged that when they sing to their child, they are continuing a practice that is shared globally and stretches back into the mists of time.

If you are plagued by negative thoughts,  depression  and  anxiety  you are at double the risk of developing  Alzheimer's disease  (than the general population is).    

Researchers at Rush University (Chicago, USA) also found that  antidepressants  reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's.    

They said that  stress  levels tend to remain constant during an individual's life.  The hippocampal area of the brain (plays a vital role in learning and memory) undergoes changes when the person has a great deal of stress.    

Dr. Robert Wilson (lead researcher) said many of the undesirable effects of stress on the brain can be blocked by drugs.  He also stressed than more research is needed before we can determine whether the use of antidepressants could help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease.    

The scientists studied the brains of 141 people (of which 57 had Alzheimer's who died during the study).    

They fond that people who were susceptible to high levels of stress did not always show the signs of the plaques and tangles of protein in the brain (closely linked to Alzheimer's).  This enabled them to rule out the theory that high stress levels were an early symptom of Alzheimer's.    

Previous studies have also linked Alzheimer's to stress and depression. However, methodological problems had made it difficult to draw firm conclusions.    

Professor Clive Ballard (Director at the Alzheimer's Society) said 'This work takes our understanding forward substantially as it highlights stress and mood symptoms as an important trigger of subsequent  dementia  in a very rigorous long-term follow-up study.  There are several possible explanations. Most likely, the stress itself results in an increase in certain hormones, such as cortisol which may be damaging to the brain.  Alternatively, an underlying disease process such as damage to the small blood vessels triggers both the depression and the dementia. Unravelling these issues offers the exciting potential to prevent or delay dementia in many at-risk people.' ",0

Babies find it easier to learn words with repetitive syllables rather than mixed sounds, a study suggests.
 
Assessments of language learning in 18-month-olds suggest that children are better at grasping the names of objects with repeated syllables, over words with non-identical syllables.
 
Researchers say the study may help explain why some words or phrases, such as 'train' and 'good night', have given rise to versions with repeated syllables, such as choo-choo and night-night.
 
The researchers say such words are easier for infants to learn, and may provide them with a starter point for vocabulary learning.

A team from the University of Edinburgh assessed the infants' language learning behaviour in a series of visual and attention tests using pictures on a computer screen of two unfamiliar objects.
 
The two objects were named with made-up words which were communicated to the infants by a recorded voice - one with two identical syllables, for example neenee, and the other without repeated syllables, such as bolay.
 
The infants were then tested for their recognition of each made-up word. Recordings of their eye movements showed they looked more reliably at the object labelled with repeated syllables, than the other object.
 
Researchers validated their results with a control test, in which the infants responded to pictures of familiar objects - such as a dog or an apple.

Previous studies show that infants more easily learn patterns involving repetition in visual sequences and musical notes. Researchers say these latest findings show that this tendency also applies to word learning.
 
Lead researcher Mitsuhiko Ota, of the University of Edinburgh's School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, said: ""This is the first evidence to show that infants have a strong bias in learning new words. It also shows that there may be a good reason why in so many cultures across the world, existing adult words and expressions are replaced by words with repeated syllables in baby-talk vocabulary. Some examples could be tum-tum, mama, dada, din-din and wee-wee. "" 

The study is published in the journal Language Learning and Development.

It is common knowledge that eating fruits and vegetables is essential to maintain a healthy body.

It is also becoming clear, as research mounts, that a diet featuring fewer animal products is also a healthier option.

For instance, a study published in 2013 that followed almost 70,000 people concluded that a vegetarian diet lowered the risk of cancer.

Similarly, a study published in Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases in the same year followed more than 15,000 individuals and found that a vegetarian diet lessened the risk of diabetes.

As a final example, a meta-analysis of more than 250 studies, published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2014, demonstrated that a vegetarian diet significantly reduces blood pressure.

The latest study in this vein once again looked at the effect of a vegetarian diet on diabetes. However, this study also looked at the quality of the vegetarian diet. 

They took into account whether the vegetarian diet was high in nutritious plant-based foods, such as whole grains, fresh fruits, and vegetables, and contrasted it with less healthy vegetarian diets that included items like refined grains, potatoes, and sweetened beverages.

The team, headed up by Ambika Satija, also collated information about the amount of animal-based foods that the participants consumed.

In all, the study used data from more than 20,000 male and female health professionals across the United States over a 20-year period. The participants filled out regular questionnaires covering diet, medical history, current diagnoses, and lifestyle. 

To evaluate each individual's diet, the team used a plant-based diet index; animal-derived foods were given low scores, whereas plant-derived foods received higher scores.

The team found that a diet low in animal products, but high in plant products, reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by 20 percent.

When the researchers split the plant-based diets into healthier and unhealthier versions, they found that it impacted heavily on the risk of type 2 diabetes. Healthy plant-based diets produced a 34 percent reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, and the less healthy plant-based diets were linked to a 16 percent increased risk of the condition. 

This implies that abstaining from animal products is not sufficient to stave off type 2 diabetes. Simply skipping the unhealthier items is not enough; it is important to make sure that healthier plant-based food items are included in the diet.
""A shift to a dietary pattern higher in healthful plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in animal-based foods, especially red and processed meats, can confer substantial health benefits in reducing risk of type 2 diabetes.""Senior author Frank Hu, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health
The team found that just a relatively modest drop in the consumption of animal-based products, from five to six servings down to four servings per day, reduced type 2 diabetes incidence.

A diet high in plant-based foods is thought to reduce type 2 diabetes risk thanks to their high levels of antioxidants, fiber, micronutrients - such as magnesium - and unsaturated fatty acids. The lower levels of saturated fats in plant-based foods might also play a role. 

Additionally, the authors theorize that a vegetarian diet has a positive influence on the gut's microbiome, which could also help reduce type 2 diabetes.

Although the study used a large sample of participants, there are some limitations. The main issue is the use of self-reported dietary behavior. However, because the data was taken cumulatively over a number of years, the potential for error is minimized.

The researchers conclude that, as previously demonstrated, a diet with lower quantities of animal products is healthier than one with higher levels. But, they also show that the quality of the diet plays an important role.

The findings suggest the policy may help identify children with autism sooner so they can benefit from early intervention.

An abstract of the study, ""Age of Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder in an Ethnically Diverse Population Before and after the 2007 AAP Recommendation for Universal Screening,"" was presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies 2016 Meeting on May 1, 2016.

Researchers compared two groups of children initially diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) between 2003 and 2012 at a university-affiliated developmental center in the Bronx: those born before 2005, a pivotal year because children born then would have been 24 months old when the AAP recommendation was issued, and those born in 2005 or later. They found the average age of diagnosis for those born before 2005 was just under four years old; for those born during or after 2005, it was roughly two-and-a-half years old.

""Our research shows that children evaluated before the AAP recommended universal pediatric screening were more likely to be diagnosed at an older age and with more severe autistic symptoms and more impaired adaptive functioning,""said lead author Maria Valicenti-McDermott, M.D., M.S. an assistant professor of pediatrics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and an attending physician at the Children's Evaluation and Rehabilitation Center at Montefiore Health System. ""This shift has been critical in light of research showing the significant impact early intervention can have for children with ASD,"" she said.

Dr. Valicenti-McDermott said the significant drop in age of diagnoses affected all ethnic groups, including Latino and African American children. This is important, she said, because demographic factors such as race and ethnicity are linked with later diagnoses, fewer concerns about possible symptoms of autism being expressed by families or asked about by providers, and possible worse overall outcomes.

""Despite data supporting the benefit of earlier therapy for children with autism and ongoing efforts to overcome obstacles to delays in diagnosis, children who are Latino or African-American are still diagnosed later than white children,"" Dr. Valicenti-McDermott said. She said additional research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of universal autism screening. Earlier this year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded there wasn't enough evidence to recommend universal autism screening of young children when no concerns of autism spectrum disorder have been raised by their parents or clinical provider.

""It remains unclear at this point whether the significant drop in average age of diagnosis we found was entirely the result of pediatrician universal screening or the effect of the national campaign to increase awareness of ASD in general and the importance of an early diagnosis in particular,"" Dr. Valicenti-McDermott said. ""But given the undisputed benefit of early identification of autism, sorting out the contribution of universal screening to this pattern will be an important next step to address the concerns of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force regarding the benefits of early screening."" 

Dr. Valicenti-McDermott presented the abstract Age of Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder in an Ethnically Diverse Population Before and After the 2007 AAP Recommendation for Universal Screening on Sunday, May 1 at 5:45 p.m. in Exhibit Hall F at the Baltimore Convention Center. Only the abstract was presented at the meeting. In some cases, the researcher may have more data available to share with media, or may be preparing a longer article for submission to a journal.

Urban neighborhoods in Ontario, Canada, that were characterized by more walkable design were associated with decreased prevalence of overweight and obesity and decreased incidence of diabetes between 2001 and 2012, according to a study appearing in the May 24/31 issue of JAMA.
 
The global increase in obesity is a major health problem. One approach to reduce obesity through diet and exercise that is gaining interest among public health professionals and urban planners is to redesign the built environment to offer more opportunities for physical activity and healthy eating. Neighborhoods that favor pedestrian activities - those with high population density, high numbers of destinations within walking distance of residential areas, and well-connected streets - are characterized by higher rates of walking and bicycling for transportation and lower rates of car use.
  
Gillian L. Booth, M.D., of the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, and colleagues examined whether urban neighborhoods that are more walkable are associated with a slower increase in overweight, obesity, and diabetes than less walkable neighborhoods. The researchers used annual provincial health care (n = 3 million per year) and biennial Canadian Community Health Survey (n = 5,500 per cycle) data for adults (30-64 years) living in Southern Ontario cities. Neighborhood walkability was derived from a validated index, which included 4 equally weighted components: population density, residential density, walkable destinations (number of retail stores, services [e.g., libraries, banks, community centers], and schools within a 10-minute walk), and street connectivity. Neighborhoods were ranked and classified into quintiles from lowest (quintile 1) to highest (quintile 5) walkability.
  
There were 8,777 neighborhoods included in the study. In 2001, the adjusted prevalence of overweight and obesity was lower in quintile 5 vs quintile 1 (43 percent vs 54 percent). Between 2001 and 2012, the prevalence increased in less walkable neighborhoods, while the prevalence did not significantly change in areas of higher walkability. In 2001, the adjusted diabetes incidence was lower in quintile 5 than other quintiles and declined by 2012. In contrast, diabetes incidence did not change significantly in less walkable areas.
  
Rates of walking or cycling and public transit use were significantly higher, and that of car use lower in quintile 5 vs quintile 1 at each time point, although daily walking and cycling frequencies increased only modestly from 2001 to 2011 in highly walkable areas. Leisure-time physical activity, diet, and smoking patterns did not vary by walkability and were relatively stable over time.
  
The authors note that the ""ecologic nature of these findings and the lack of evidence that more walkable urban neighborhood design was associated with increased physical activity suggest that further research is necessary to assess whether the observed associations are causal.""
 
Andrew G. Rundle, Dr.P.H., of Columbia University, New York, and Steven B. Heymsfield, M.D., of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, LSU System, Baton Rouge, comment on the findings of this study in an accompanying editorial.
 
""The findings of the study by Creatore et al reported in this issue of JAMA provide further large-scale and longitudinal support for the hypothesis that urban design choices promoting pedestrian activity are associated with greater engagement in active transport (walking and cycling), lower prevalence of overweight/obesity, and lower diabetes incidence at the population level. This study will make a prominent contribution to the research base that informs the urban design and health policy debates for years to come.""

176,273504,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315622.php,Toward understanding when eating soy might help or harm in breast cancer treatment,Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer,Nutrition / Diet,,,2,3,2,3,3,3,1,1,3,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,"
Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers have used animal models to reveal new information about the impact - positive and negative - that soy consumption could have on a common breast cancer treatment.

The scientists have uncovered the biological pathways in rats by which longtime soy consumption improves effectiveness of tamoxifen and reduces breast cancer recurrence. But they also show why eating or drinking soy-based foods for the first time while being treated with tamoxifen can, conversely, reduce effectiveness of the drug, and promote recurrence.

The study, published in Clinical Cancer Research, uncovers the molecular biology behind how soy consumption, especially its most active isoflavone, genistein, affects tamoxifen - both positively and negatively.

It also mirrors what has been observed in breast cancer patients, says the study's senior investigator Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, PhD, professor of oncology at Georgetown Lombardi.

""There has long been a paradox concerning genistein, which has the similar structure as estrogen and activates both human estrogen receptors to a degree. Estrogen drives most breast cancer growth, yet high soy intake among women in Asian countries has been linked to a breast cancer rate that is five times lower than Western women, who eat much less soy,"" she says. ""So why is soy, which mimics estrogen, protective in Asian women?""

More than 70 percent of the 1.67 million women diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide in 2012 was estrogen-receptor positive, and tamoxifen and other endocrine therapies meant to reduce the ability of estrogen to promote cancer growth, are the most common drugs used for these cancers. Although endocrine therapies can be highly effective in preventing or treating breast cancer, about half of patients who use them exhibit resistance and/or have cancer recurrence.

Employing a more advanced rat model of breast cancer and tamoxifen use than has been used in past studies, the researchers found that the timing of genistein intake is the central issue.

Longtime sustained use of genistein before development of breast cancer improves overall immunity against cancer, thus protecting against cancer development and recurrence, says the study's lead researcher, Xiyuan Zhang, PhD.

""It also inhibits a mechanism called autophagy that would allow cancer cells to survive, which explains why it helps tamoxifen work,"" says Zhang, a member of Hilakivi-Clarke's laboratory when this study was conducted. She is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institutes of Health.

Previous studies in women show no evidence of adverse effects of soy intake on breast cancer outcome, the researchers say, adding that research has also shown that Asian and Caucasian women who consumed as little as 1/3rd cup of soymilk daily (10 mg. of isoflavones) had the lowest risk of breast cancer recurrence.

The animal studies suggest it is a different story when soy consumption begins after breast cancer develops.

Starting consuming genistein in a diet after breast cancer develops in the animals did not trigger anti-tumor immune response to eliminate cancer cells, Zhang says. ""We do not know yet why this made the animals resistant to the beneficial effects of tamoxifen and increased risk of cancer recurrence,"" she continued.

Animals consuming genistein as adults on had a 7 percent chance of breast cancer recurrence after tamoxifen treatment, compared with a 33 percent recurrence with rats exposed to genistein only after breast cancer developed.

""We have solved the puzzle of genistein and breast cancer in our rat model, which perfectly explains the paradox seen in earlier animal studies and patients,"" says Hilakivi-Clarke. ""While many oncologists advise their patients not to take isoflavone supplements or consume soy foods, our findings suggest a more nuanced message - if these results hold true for women. Our results suggest that breast cancer patients should continue consuming soy foods after diagnosis, but not to start them if they have not consumed genistein previously.""

This work was supported by NIH grants (U54-CA149147, U01-CA184902, and R01-CA164384), and an AICR grant. In addition, X. Zhang received a donation to support her PhD thesis work from Solomon family.

177,271345,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/313442.php,New approach to treating type 1 diabetes aims to limit damage caused by immune system,Diabetes,Diabetes,Immune System / Vaccines,,,2,2,4,2,3,4,1,2,2,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,"
Researchers at the University of Cambridge have taken the first step towards developing a new form of treatment for type 1 diabetes which, if successful, could mean an end to the regular insulin injections endured by people affected by the disease, many of whom are children.

Type 1 diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases in children and there is a rapid increase in the number affected each year. About 400,000 people in the UK are affected, 29,000 of them children. In type 1 diabetes, the body's own immune system mistakes the insulin producing cells of the pancreas as harmful, attacks and then destroys them. The result is a lack of insulin, which is essential for transporting glucose from the blood into cells. Without insulin, glucose levels in the blood rise, causing short term and long term damage: hence patients have to inject themselves several times a day with insulin to compensate.

In a study published in the open access journal PLOS Medicine, a team led by researchers from the JDRF/Wellcome Trust Diabetes Inflammation Laboratory at the Cambridge Institute of Medical Research used a drug to regulate the immune system with the aim of preventing a patient's immune cells attacking their insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

The drug, aldesleukin, recombinant interleukin -2 (IL-2), is currently used at high doses to treat certain types of kidney tumours and skin cancers. At much lower doses, aldesleukin enhances the ability of immune cells called regulatory T cells (Tregs) to stop the immune system losing control once stimulated and prevent it from damaging the body's own organs (autoimmunity).

Critical to this approach was to first determine the effects of single doses of aldesleukin on Tregs in patients with type 1 diabetes. To achieve this the team employed a state-of-the-art trial design combined with extensive immune monitoring in 40 participants with type 1 diabetes, and found doses to increase Tregs by between 10-20%. These doses are potentially enough to prevent immune cells from attacking the body, but not so much that they would supress the body's natural defences, which are essential for protecting us from infection by invading bacteria or viruses.

The researchers also found that the absence of response of some participants in previous trials may be explained by the daily dosing regimen of aldesleukin used. The current trial results suggest that daily dosing results in Tregs becoming less sensitive to the drug, and the recommendation from the study is that the drug should not be administered on a daily basis for optimal immune outcomes.

""Type 1 diabetes is fatal if left untreated, but the current treatment - multiple daily injections of insulin - are at best inconvenient, at worst painful, particularly for children,"" says Dr Frank Waldron-Lynch, who led the trial. ""Our goal is to develop a treatment that could see the end to the need for these life-long, daily injections by curtailing the early damage caused by the patient's own immune system.

""Our work is at an early stage, but it uses a drug that occurs naturally within the body to restore the immune system to health in these patients. Whereas previous approaches have focused on suppressing the immune system, we are looking to fine-tune it. Our next step is to find the optimal, 'Goldilocks' treatment regimen - too little and it won't stop the damage, too much and it could impair our natural defences, but just right and it would enhance the body's own response.""

The researchers say that any treatment would initially focus on people who are newly-diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, many of whom are still able to produce sufficient insulin to prevent complications from the disease. The treatment could then help prevent further damage and help them to continue to produce a small amount of insulin for a longer period of time.

The research was largely funded by the type 1 diabetes charity JDRF, the Wellcome Trust and the Sir Jules Thorn Charitable Trust, with support from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.

A University of Cincinnati (UC) surgeon recently performed what is believed to be the world's first pediatric laparoscopic liver surgery, a specialized procedure for removing cancerous liver tumors without the need for a major incision.
   
Mark Thomas, MD, an assistant professor and transplant surgeon at UC, performed the operation in a 2-year-old boy with  liver cancer  on May 24 at La Raza Pediatric Medical Hospital in Mexico City.
   
Liver cancer is rare in children--less than 150 cases are diagnosed each year compared to more than 18,000 in adults--so the disease often misdiagnosed as  constipation , food intolerance or  anorexia  until it is in an advanced and difficult-to-treat stage.
   
This patient's symptoms had been dismissed as such for several months before physicians confirmed he had hepatoblastoma of the liver, a type of  cancer  that starts in the organ's cells (hepatocytes) and develops into one or multiple tumors. Thomas was invited to the La Raza Pediatric Medical Hospital to perform the patient's surgery and teach two lectures on the specialized minimally invasive procedure.
   
Laparoscopic (minimally invasive) surgery is a method of operating inside the abdomen through small, tube-like ports using a fiber-optic light source, camera and specialized instruments. Known as laparoscopic liver resection, this procedure requires incisions so small (about three-inches) that they leave only minimal scarring.
   
Two months post-surgery, the patient is doing well and is expected to have a full recovery after several additional rounds of  chemotherapy .
   
Thomas says the procedure is a safe, effective alternative to traditional ""open"" surgery for liver cancer--which requires up to a 30-inch incision. It also is available for patients with advanced liver disease who cannot tolerate the standard operation. The minimally invasive laparoscopic approach is most often used to remove liver tumors and treat other liver diseases.
   
""Laparoscopic liver resection results in less pain and faster recovery times for patients,"" Thomas explains. ""Adult patients can usually start eating again a day after surgery and are back to work within one or two weeks.""
   
""Now we've shown that the same procedure can improve survival for patients with childhood liver cancer,"" he adds.
   
Thomas says the laparoscopic liver procedure has the same success rates as traditional open surgery and the patient usually goes home within two days.
   
The liver, one of the body's largest organs, helps metabolize food and medicine absorbed from the intestines in the blood supply, produces bile to help digest fats, and stores energy-producing glycogen (sugar).
   
Primary liver cancer--which grows from within the organ as opposed to spreading there from another area of the body--is rare. In adults, the most common type of primary liver cancer is hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC) and in pediatric patients it is hepatoblastoma. Both develop from hepatocytes and can occur as one or multiple tumors. HCC accounts for 80 percent of all primary liver cancers. Colorectal, breast and gastric cancers also commonly spread to the liver.
   
To perform the laparoscopic liver procedure, carbon dioxide gas is pumped into the patient's abdomen to increase the operative area and improve visualization of the  tumor . The surgeon then makes two to four small incisions on the right side of the rib cage to accommodate the laparoscope, a tiny ""telescope"" equipped with a camera, and other specialized surgical instruments. The surgeon then severs and ties off tumor's blood supply, cuts out the tumor itself, places it inside a sealed bag, and removes it through one of the incisions.
   
""The liver is a self-healing organ,"" explains Thomas, ""so once the cancerous tumor is removed the area typically heals within two to four weeks.""
   
Research suggests that  cirrhosis , a condition that results in scarring of the liver tissue and long-term  hepatitis B  and C infections, can increase the risk for liver cancer. People who abuse alcohol, smoke cigarettes or are obese are also at an increased risk for the disease.
   
Thomas and his team perform about 250 laparoscopic liver cases a year. According to a literature review, there are no published reports of laparoscopic liver resection in a pediatric patient with cancer.
   
""Only a handful of centers in the world perform the number of specialized laparoscopic liver surgeries that we do in Cincinnati,"" adds Thomas.
   
The American Cancer Society estimates that about 18,000 new cases of primary liver cancer and bile duct cancer will be diagnosed in the United States during 2006. Because of a higher incidence rate of hepatitis B and C, liver cancer is more common in developing countries in Africa and East Asia than in the United States.

If you really want to get out of a foul mood, try listening to a little music.
   
A new study out of Penn State (USA) finds that music really can soothe the savage beast, up to a point, and it really doesn't matter what kind of music you listen to. As long as you like it.
   
'If you like music and choose to listen to it, it's probably going to make you feel better regardless of what type it is,' says associate professor of psychology Valerie N. Stratton.
   
Stratton and associate music professor Annette H. Zalanowski, of Penn State's Altoona campus, teamed up to take music research out of the laboratory and put it in the real world in which we live. They wanted to see when people listen to music, what types of music they prefer, and what types of moods that music induces. 
   
It turns out that most of us listen to it a lot, but usually when we're doing something else. 
   
'We've been looking at music and behavior for quite a few years, and it finally struck us that most of the things we were doing, and most of the things that other people were doing, were within lab settings,' says Stratton.    'There was really very little out there that looked at how people listened to music in their daily lives.' 
   
So the researchers recruited 47 college students, including 25 music majors, and asked them to keep a diary for 14 days, noting the kinds of music they listened to. They were also asked to pick various moods from a list, showing their moods before, during and after listening to the music. 

   
The Kids Like Rock
   
This is not exactly a startling finding, but the researchers found that college-age students overwhelmingly prefer to listen to rock music, whether hard, heavy or modern, and that includes music majors. If they weren't listing to hard rock, the non-music majors preferred country and soft rock. The music majors opted for classical and jazz after rock. 
   

The researchers were a bit surprised to find that non-music majors listened to more music than the music majors. The non-music majors listened to an average of 161 minutes of music per day, compared to 117.7 minutes for the music majors. 
   
It's not clear exactly why that turned out to be the case, but it may be that the music students spend more time listening to music in their classes, so listening during their free time is too much like the proverbial postman taking a walk on his day off. 

   
Mood Music
   
If the results of the study apply to all of us, regardless of age, we don't spend a whole lot of time just sitting and listening to music. Most of the participants in the study listened to music while doing something else, and that activity apparently influenced their choice of music. 
   
Soft background music is neat while socializing with your friends, but if it's time to hop on the exercise machine and work on those abs, a little jazz might be preferable, the researchers found. 
   
The results of the study suggest that music is terrific when it comes to reinforcing, or elevating our positive moods, and can chase away some of our negative feelings, with one peculiar finding. 
   
Among the non-music majors, sad, hateful and aggressive moods eased up a bit. But that didn't work for the music majors. For them, those feelings remained either unchanged, or rose slightly. 
   
Stratton speculates that perhaps students who are hoping for a career in music may be a little more in tune to the emotional impact of music, and may even choose certain types of music to stimulate that effect. Maybe it's that old bromide at work, to be a great artist you've got to suffer along the way. So turn on a little Mahler and weep. 
   
But oddly enough, the study found that the type of music was less important than rather the listeners really liked whatever they were listening to. Rock, the music of choice, made just about all the students 'optimistic, joyful, friendly, relaxed and calm,' according to the findings, published in a recent issue of Psychology and Education/ An Interdisciplinary Journal.

   
Melodies and Memories
   
It probably wouldn't do that for everybody, and that gives rise to an old question. Why does music have such a profound impact on our emotions? 
   
Stratton says there are probably some physiological reasons. Different types of music may induce different 'brain rhythms,' she says. Fast music may cause the heart to speed up, for example. 
   
But there are also cultural reasons why some music works for us, provoking very specific emotions. 
   
Our 'past associations' with certain pieces may have a major impact on how we react to a particular song. 
   
Hearing a very happy tune may have a sad affect on someone who associates that song with an unfortunate experience. 
   
'If you heard that song during a very sad event in your life, that's going to bring back that kind of memory,' Stratton says. 'It's a very personal thing.' 
   
My layman's opinion is that music works for us because it expresses the harmonics of the soul. 
   
I haven't the foggiest idea what that means, but it sounds neat. ",1

Type-1 diabetes occurs when immune cells attack the pancreas. EPFL scientists have now discovered what may trigger this attack, opening new directions for treatments.

Type-1 diabetes is the rarest but most aggressive form of diabetes, usually affecting children and adolescents. The patient's own immune cells begin to attack the cells in the pancreas that make insulin, eventually eliminating its production in the body. The immune cells target certain proteins inside the insulin-producing cells. However, it is unclear how this actually happens. EPFL scientists have now discovered that the immune attack in type-1 diabetes may be triggered by the release of proteins from the pancreas itself, as well as the package they come in. The work, which has significant implications for therapy strategies, is published in Diabetes.

Diabetes is a disease in which the body produces inadequate or no amounts of the hormone insulin, which regulates sugar levels in the blood. Insulin is produced by a group of cells in the pancreas called beta cells. In type-1 diabetes, the patient's immune cells specifically attack beta cells, thereby disrupting the production of insulin. However, we don't actually know what causes the immune cells to attack in the first place.

Scientists from EPFL's Institute of Bioengineering, led by Steinunn Baekkeskov, have now discovered that pancreatic beta cells actually secrete proteins that are targeted by the immune attack. But it's not only the proteins that cause problems; the researchers found that it is also their packaging.

That packaging comes in the form of small vesicles called exosomes, which are secreted by all cell types to distribute various molecules with different functions. But previous studies have shown that exosomes can also activate the immune system. Building on this, the EPFL researchers looked at exosomes from human and animal pancreatic beta cells.

The results showed that rat and human pancreatic beta cells release three proteins known to be associated with type-1 diabetes, and are in fact used by clinicians to diagnose its onset in people.

The researchers might have also discovered why the immune attack on the pancreas begins in the first place: When insulin-making beta cells were exposed to stress, they released high amounts of exosomes, which they also ""decorated"" with proteins that activate immune cells. These powerfully inflammatory proteins may be involved in induction of autoimmunity in the disease.

The hope is that this will lead to new directions in developing more effective treatments that focus on developing exosome mimics that contain molecules inhibiting rather than stimulating immune cells. These synthetic molecules would be taken up by the patient's immune cells and would block them from attacking beta cells.

This work was carried out at the EPFL's Institute of Bioengineering (IBI), by lead authors Chiara Cianciaruso and Edward A. Phelps, with contributions from EPFL's Proteomics Core Facility, Bio-Electron Microscopy Core Facility, Bio-Imaging Core Facility, the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research. It involves a collaboration with the European Consortium on Islet Transplantation (ECIT) Islets for Basic Research Program at the University Hospital of Geneva and at the San Raffaele Scientific Institute of Milan.

181,272709,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/314819.php,Can we blame delicious food for our holiday weight gain?,Obesity / Weight Loss / Fitness,Obesity / Weight Loss / Fitness,Nutrition / Diet,,,3,3,4,5,4,4,3,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,"
Most of us have heard the saying that ""if it tastes good, it must be bad for you."" Although commonly held, this old adage may not contain much truth after all.

A team of researchers led by Dr. Michael Tordoff, a physiological psychologist at Monell Chemical Senses Center in Pennsylvania, set out to test this belief in more detail. ""Most people think that good-tasting food causes obesity,"" he explains. 

Tordoff was unconvinced, and he therefore designed a range of experiments to see whether the theory held any water. His findings were recently published in the journal Physiology & Behavior.

It has been established that if you feed a mouse cookies, chips, and cream, they will become obese. But is it the flavor of the foods that cause overeating? Or, could it be the nutrient density that promotes the gorging? After all, animals have evolved to seek out fatty and sugary foods as a matter of survival.

Previous studies that have drawn conclusions about good taste (in this context, meaning flavor and texture) and its effect on weight gain have been flawed. For instance, many did not take into account the impact of variety on feeding behavior; having a spread of different foods to choose from can cause one to over-indulge. A buffet is a prime example of this.

According to the authors of the recent research, only three studies to date have looked specifically at the influence of flavor on weight gain. None of these studies were conclusive, however. The reasons for this include sample size and, once again, the effects of variety.

The first phase of Tordoff's study involved establishing whether mice would prefer food with added oily or sweet ingredients that were non-nutritive. The mice were served two pots of chow - one standard, and one with either a sucralose sweetener or mineral oil (both of which are calorie free).

As expected, the mice preferred the mineral oil chow and sucralose chow. They virtually ignored the
plainer fare. In fact, the mice thought so little of the standard chow that, according to the study authors, they ""often defecated in the cup containing the plain diet.""

The second phase of the trial involved splitting the mice into three groups, with each being fed a different diet for 6 weeks: plain chow, chow with mineral oil, or chow with sucralose.

At the end of the 6-week period, the mice were measured. There were no significant differences in weight or fat content in any of the three experimental groups. In other words, even the more tasty foods did not encourage overeating.
""Even though we gave mice delicious diets over a prolonged period, they did not gain excess weight. People say that 'if a food is good-tasting it must be bad for you,' but our findings suggest this is not the case. It should be possible to create foods that are both healthy and good-tasting.""Dr. Michael Tordoff
After the 6-week diet, the mice were still found to preferentially eat the tastier chow when offered standard chow, demonstrating that they had not tired of the enhanced food.

In a third arm of the research, the team fed the mice a high-fat diet that is known to contribute to obesity in mice. The researchers added sucralose to this food to make it even more delicious. They found, however, that the time taken for the mice to become obese was no different; the increase in pleasant taste did not influence the amount of food eaten. In fact, sucralose slightly reduced weight gain and fat stores.

The conclusion drawn is that good-tasting food alone does not influence obesity. Flavor determines what we choose to eat, but not how much of it we eat over the longer term.

182,268956,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311036.php,What's the Best Bread for People with Diabetes?,Diabetes,Diabetes,Nutrition / Diet,,,3,3,2,4,4,3,3,3,4,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,"
Bread is perhaps one of the most widely used types of food on the planet. It can also be a food that poses a health risk for people with diabetes.

Despite the risk, bread can be one of the hardest foods to give up. Fortunately, there are breads on the market that don't raise blood sugar to extreme levels.

Whole-grain breads with high-fiber ingredients, like oats and bran, may be the best option for people with diabetes.

Making bread at home with specific, diabetes-friendly ingredients may also help reduce the impact bread has on blood sugar levels. 

Diabetes has two main types: type 1 and type 2.

People with type 1 diabetes have difficulty producing insulin, which is a hormone that ""captures"" blood sugar (or glucose) and transfers it into cells. Glucose is the preferred energy source for cells.

Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. This type of diabetes is also the easier form to prevent and manage with lifestyle changes and medication. According to the World Health Organization, over 422 million people have type 2 diabetes worldwide.

In the earlier phase of type 2 diabetes, the pancreas can produce insulin, but cells have become insensitive to its effects. This is sometimes due to poor diet, genetics, and lifestyle habits. Because of this, cells can't access blood sugar following a meal. 

Nutrition plays a crucial role in diabetes control. It's only through putting proper dietary planning into practice that good blood sugar management can be accomplished. A good diet must also be combined with lifestyle changes and medication.

A carbohydrate is one of the three major nutrients essential to human health. However, carbohydrates also raise blood sugar and can reduce effective diabetes control. This is mainly because carbohydrates break down into blood sugar. 

The key to keeping blood sugar in check following a meal is to choose food items that contain quality carbohydrates. Quality carbohydrates are those that rate low or medium on the glycemic index. 

The glycemic index is a measurement of individual foods and their effects on blood sugar. There are three basic categories of the glycemic index: low, medium, and high. 

Low-glycemic foods are those that contain little to no carbohydrates. These include: 

Medium-glycemic foods include: 

High-glycemic foods include: 

For people who want to make their own diabetes-friendly bread and are using a standard bread recipe, there are ingredients that can be added to the mix to lower the glycemic index of the final product. High-fiber, high-protein, and high-fat ingredients may be important additions to reduce the impact the bread has on blood sugar.

These ingredients include things like:

Bakers will usually want to replace one-fourth of regular flour with an equal proportion of the other, healthier ingredients. For example, if a favorite bread recipe calls for 2 cups of flour, half a cup of flour can be replaced with half a cup of flaxseed meal. Swapping out all-white flour for whole-wheat pastry flour is also a good idea. 

Once the bread is baked, the glycemic index can be reduced further. People can spread on healthy fats like avocado or flaxseed oil to replace mayonnaise and other sugary, high-glycemic spreads.

Commercial bread found at most grocery stores is usually made with white flour. Refined white flour is absent of fiber and can send blood sugar skyrocketing. Even bread marketed as ""wheat bread"" may be made with refined wheat and not whole grain.

Some brands that identify their bread as ""seven grain"" or ""nine grain"" only use those grains on the crust while the majority of the bread is still made with refined white flour.

It's this deceptive form of advertising that can lead many people with diabetes to choose the wrong bread for their health concerns.

Here are four types of breads that, along with an overall healthy lifestyle, may be healthier options for diabetes control:

Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that the body can't digest. It keeps bowels regular and assists in promoting a feeling of fullness. Fiber is also a significant nutrient that helps control blood sugar. 

Studies have shown that soluble fiber can slow the rate of digestion and reduce the rise in blood sugar after eating. This is why fiber is said to lower the glycemic index of a food. 

Breads with soluble fiber added to them may be a helpful way to manage blood sugar via the diet.

People should keep in mind that fiber-enriched whole-grain breads are still relatively high in carbohydrates. Eating these products in moderation is important.

While high in carbohydrates, a multi-grain bread is typically made with whole, unrefined grains. These grains are generally high in naturally occurring fiber (not enriched), an important ingredient for lessening the impact that carbohydrates have on blood sugar. 

When choosing whole-grain bread, people should find one that includes ingredients like oats, quinoa, buckwheat, whole-grain wheat, brown rice, bran, and barley.

In addition to being lower on the glycemic index (compared with wheat flour), many whole grains offer a number of other nutrients, like zinc, vitamin E, and protein.

Sandwich bread isn't the only option. Tortillas can provide a tasty, versatile, and sometimes healthier choice for sandwiches.

As the diabetes epidemic continues to escalate worldwide, companies are pushing out a wider range of low-carbohydrate tortillas to appeal to health-conscious consumers.

Many of the low-carbohydrate tortillas available on the market have added fiber to reduce the carbohydrate count. Some tortillas are simply made with low-carbohydrate ingredients, like whey and soy protein powders. 

People can use low-carbohydrate tortillas as they would use bread, wrapping their favorite sandwich ingredients in the tortilla. Tortillas can also be used for mini pizzas, homemade burritos, and tacos.

Perhaps the best choice for diabetes-friendly bread is one made without flour or grains. While flourless sprouted-grain breads are available and are a good source of fiber, they are still rich in carbohydrates. 

Grain-free breads made with ingredients like almond flour, coconut flour, and flaxseed meal can be found in specialty health food stores. Check the nutrition facts, since they may also be higher in calories.

There are also many recipes for making grain-free bread on the Internet. A search term like ""grain-free bread recipe"" will bring up some low-carbohydrate bread recipes. These breads tend to be more expensive to make and purchase and often yield a smaller amount compared with traditional bread recipes, however.

Unless specified by a doctor or dietitian, patients with diabetes don't necessarily need to eliminate bread or bread products from their diet. Using low-carbohydrate or multi-grain, whole-grain bread options may be the best bet for keeping bread in the diet without posing a great health risk. 

Continuing an exercise program, using doctor-prescribed medications, and consuming mostly low-glycemic foods are also the most effective ways for controlling blood sugar while allowing people with diabetes to continue eating the foods they enjoy.

Researchers at Queen's University Belfast and University College London have discovered that a drug, originally developed to treat cardiovascular disease, has the potential to reduce diabetes related blindness.

According to recent WHO global estimates, 422 million people have diabetes. One of the most common complications of this disease is vision loss.  Diabetic Macular Oedema occurs in approximately 7 per cent of patients with diabetes and is one of the most common causes of blindness in the Western World. In the UK, this sight-threatening complication of diabetic retinopathy is associated with estimated health and social care costs of £116 million. The socio-economic burden will only increase with prevalence of diabetes rising by more than 50 per cent by 2030. 

Queen's and UCL researchers, in partnership with  GlaxoSmithKline, found that the drug Darapladib inhibits an enzyme which is increased in people with diabetes and causes blood vessel leakage in the eye which leads to swelling of the retina and severe vision loss.

Currently, the most common treatments for patients with Diabetic Macular Oedema is an injection of a drug directly into to the eye every 4-6 weeks.  This therapy is very expensive and not effective for about half of all patients with Diabetic Macular Oedema. 

The discovery by the Queen's and UCL teams demonstrates that Darapladib in form of a tablet has potential to reduce the need for monthly injections and provide protection against vision loss in a much wider group of patients with diabetes.

Speaking about the breakthrough, Professor Alan Stitt, from the Centre for Experimental Medicine at Queen's University, said: ""Diabetes-related blindness is caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the blood vessels in the retina.  We have found that an enzyme called Lp-PLA2 which metabolises fats in the blood contributes to blood vessel damage and leakiness in the retina. The drug Darapladib acts as inhibitor of Lp-PLA2, and was originally developed for cardiovascular disease. Based on our break-though we are now planning a clinical trial and if successful we could soon see an alternative, pain-free and cost effective treatment for diabetic related blindness.""

Dr Patric Turowski from the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology said: ""With our study we show that a blood lipid produced by Lp-PLA2 constitutes a novel trigger factor in diabetic macular oedema and that use of Darapladib may not only constitute an cost-effective alternative to current DMO treatments but has the potential to be effective for patients that currently do not respond to standard treatment.""

A team of researchers led by a Virginia Tech nutrition scientist discovered a molecular mechanism behind fat cell growth and expansion that suggests obese people with Type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes may more easily accumulate fat.
 
Publishing in Cell Cycle, the researchers discovered that the formation and expansion of fat cells was associated with an increase in autophagy - a normal physiological process in which cells remodel, break down, or recycle cell parts.
 
The new study suggests that a particular protein called FoxO1 controls autophagy, which also controls the growth of fat particles in fat cells from mice.

""Earlier evidence suggests that autophagy is enhanced in fat tissue in people who are obese and have Type 2 diabetes. Our findings shed light on the mechanistic mystery of this phenomenon,"" said Zhiyong Cheng, an assistant professor of human nutrition, foods, and exercise in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and a Fralin Life Science Institute affiliate. ""Because FoxO1 is activated by insulin resistance, obese and diabetic individuals may have an increase in the process of autophagy because this protein triggers it. When this happens, it promotes fat cell formation and expansion.""
 
The study was funded by grants from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch Project and the National Institutes of Health.
 
A normal rate of fat cell formation and growth is important for the body to store energy and maintain homeostasis, explained Cheng. Evidence also suggests that fat tissue is an endocrine organ and thus responsible for the secretion of molecules that regulate various cellular functions, including metabolism and inflammation response in the body. Healthy fat tissue secretes anti-inflammatory hormones that help maintain a healthy functioning metabolism. However, fat tissue may become dysfunctional due to obesity, which increases pro-inflammation factors and promotes metabolic disorders.
 
""Abnormal fat tissue expansion might be a result of hyperactivity of the FoxO1 protein and of a nutrient surplus in obese diabetic people,"" said Cheng, who is an also affiliate of the Fralin Translational Obesity Research Center at Virginia Tech. ""Further studies from here could lead to the discovery of a drug so that the pathway could be blocked and abnormal fat cell expansion could be stopped, which would prevent the increase of adiposity, or severe body weight.""
 
""Given that FoxO1 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes, targeting it may even be beneficial for obese individuals with diabetes,"" said Yun Chau Long, one of the study's co-authors at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore, Singapore.
 
Chronic obesity is associated with increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, gallstones, breathing problems, and certain types of cancer, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. In the United States, obesity accounts for more than 300,000 deaths per year.

The author team also includes Fabio Almeida, a former Virginia Tech investigator who is now in the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Cheng and Almeida collaborated on another recent study, in which they and a team of Virginia Tech collaborators found a potential biomarker for early stage pre-diabetes.

Even if you are not overweight, your mannose levels may indicate whether you're at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) or insulin resistance (IR), a Swedish study shows.

Mannose, a simple sugar that occurs as a component of many natural polysaccharides, has been identified as a biomarker for diabetes, says Adil Mardinoglu, a systems biologist at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and a fellow at SciLifeLab. The report was published June 24 in Cell Metabolism.

""We can measure mannose in the blood of lean or obese people and identify if they have increased risk for type 2 diabetes based on their mannose levels,"" Mardinoglu says.

The researchers found that subjects with high mannose levels have a higher risk for T2D. Lead author Sunjae Lee, a researcher with SciLifeLab at KTH, says that mannose can be used as a biomarker since blood mannose levels are quite stable and not influenced by recent food intake, unlike glucose levels.

The study forces us to reconsider assumptions about the relationship between obesity and diabetes. ""Although the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes continues to dramatically increase worldwide, a clear understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of associated disorders has still been lacking,"" Lee says. ""So it is important to identify stable biomarkers that can be used for the early discovery of IR and future risk of T2D.""

Lee says the researchers used a systems biology-based approach and generated cell-specific integrated networks for liver, fat and muscle tissues.

They used these biological networks for analysis of clinical data to explain biological changes in response to obesity and IR, which provided comprehensive molecular clues. 

""Based on our integrative analysis, we think that this knowledge can be useful in the clinic for detecting subjects at high risk for T2D,"" Lee says. ""However, larger studies are required for further clinical validation of our results.""

Sugar-free and ""diet"" drinks are often seen as the healthier option - but researchers from Imperial College London have argued that they are no more helpful for maintaining a healthy weight than their full-sugar versions.

In a commentary on current research and policy into sweetened drinks, academics from Imperial College London and two Brazilian universities (University of Sao Paulo and Federal University of Pelotas) argued that sugar-free versions of drinks may be no better for weight loss or preventing weight gain than their full sugar counterparts, and may also be detrimental to the environment.

Artificially-sweetened beverages (ASBs) are alternatives to full-sugared drinks. They contain no sugar and are sweetened with artificial sweeteners instead. ASBs are often known as ""diet"" versions of soft drinks, and may be perceived by consumers as the healthier option for those who want to lose weight or reduce their sugar intake. However, there is no solid evidence to support the claims that they are any better for health or prevent obesity and obesity related diseases such as type 2 diabetes.

Professor Christopher Millett, senior investigator from Imperial's School of Public Health, said ""A common perception, which may be influenced by industry marketing, is that because 'diet' drinks have no sugar, they must be healthier and aid weight loss when used as a substitute for full sugar versions. However we found no solid evidence to support this.""

Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) such as soft drinks, fruit-flavoured drinks, and sports drinks, make up a third of UK teenagers' sugar intake, and nearly half of all sugar intake in the US. SSBs provide many calories but very few essential nutrients, and their consumption is a major cause of increasing rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

ASBs currently comprise a quarter of the global sweetened beverages market, but they are not taxed or regulated to the same extent as SSBs - perhaps due to their perceived harmlessness, say the researchers.

Despite having no or very little energy content, there is a concern that ASBs might trigger compensatory food intake by stimulating sweet taste receptors. This, together with the consumers' awareness of the low-calorie content of ASBs, may result in overconsumption of other foods, thus contributing to obesity, type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related health problems.

Professor Millett and colleagues outlined current evidence of the health effects of consuming ASBs. Although there was no direct evidence for a role of ASBs in weight gain, they found that there was no evidence that ASBs aid weight loss or prevent weight gain compared with the full sugar versions.

In addition, the production of ASBs has negative consequences for the environment, with up to 300 litres of water required to produce a 0.5 L plastic bottle of carbonated soft drink.

Dr Maria Carolina Borges, first author of the study from the Federal University of Pelotas in Brazil added: ""The lack of solid evidence on the health effects of ASBs and the potential influence of bias from industry funded studies should be taken seriously when discussing whether ASBs are adequate alternatives to SSBs.""

Professor Carlos Monteiro, co-author from the University of Sao Paulo, said: ""Taxes and regulation on SBS and not ASBs will ultimately promote the consumption of diet drinks rather than plain water - the desirable source of hydration for everyone.""

The authors added: ""Far from helping to solve the global obesity crisis, ASBs may be contributing to the problem and should not be promoted as part of a healthy diet.""

Intervention sessions, individually tailored to help people caring for family members with  dementia , show promise in reducing rates of clinical  depression , according to a multi-site study co-authored by a University of Alabama researcher.   

Study results, publishing in the  Nov. 21 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine , indicate the intervention strategies can also significantly ease the burden and improve the quality of life for the caregiver.   

\""Caring for a loved one with dementia presents a number of challenges that can seriously compromise the caregiver\'s quality of life,\"" said Dr. Louis Burgio, Distinguished Research Professor at the  Center for Mental Health and Aging   at The  University of Alabama  and principal investigator at one of the five study sites. \""For the millions of Americans who care for a loved one at home, an intervention that can improve their quality of life and lessen the burden of caregiving can make meaningful differences in their ability to better care both for themselves and their loved ones,\"" he said.   

The findings are significant, according to the researchers, because not only is caring for a loved one with dementia stressful, but the experience can contribute to the development of psychiatric and physical illnesses and increased risk for death among the caregivers.   

The researchers found that, overall, the intervention was effective across racial and ethnic groups, with the most significant improvements among Hispanic and white caregivers. In African-Americans, the intervention was effective among spouse-caregivers, but relatively ineffective among caregivers who were caring for a relative other than their husband or wife.   

The study was the first randomized, controlled trial to look at the effectiveness of a multi-component caregiver intervention on quality of life across an ethnically diverse population. About 4.5 million Americans with Alzheimer\'s disease live at home with 75 percent being cared for by family members, making caregiver health a matter of significant interest and importance.   

The study enrolled 642 people who were caring for a relative with Alzheimer\'s disease or a related disorder at sites in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa, Ala.; Memphis, Tenn.; Miami; Palo Alto, Calif.; and Philadelphia. Hispanics, whites and African-Americans were evenly represented. The more than 200 participants in each ethnic group were randomized to receive either the intervention or an approach used for controlled comparison.   

The study intervention used strategies such as role playing, problem solving, skills training,  stress  management and telephone support groups to address five areas in which caregivers commonly experience problems and that are central to caregiver quality of life: depression; caregiver burden and stress; attention to personal health needs; social support; and problem behaviors exhibited by the care recipient, such as aggressive outbursts or feelings of hopelessness.     

Based on the intensity with which each caregiver experienced problems in these areas, the intervention was tailored to meet the individual needs, providing the skills necessary to better cope with the inherent stress of round-the-clock care and helping manage troublesome behaviors in both the care recipient and themselves.   

A certified interventionist provided 12 one-on-one sessions over six months. Nine sessions took place in the caregiver\'s home, and three occurred by phone. Caregivers also participated in five structured telephone support group sessions.   

Control group participants were given educational materials and received two brief \""check-in\"" calls at three and five months. Both groups were evaluated on the five measures (depression, caregiver burden, self-care, social support and problem behaviors) and for clinical depression at the beginning of the study and at six months.   

Hispanic and white participants saw the greatest benefit. African-American spouse-caregivers also saw improvement in the problem areas as a result of the intervention, while African-Americans caring for a non-spousal relative did not see any benefit.   

In the intervention group, Hispanics had the greatest improvement in reduction of caregiver depressive symptoms and problem behaviors of the recipient. Whites saw the most impact in the area of social support, and African-American spouse-caregivers had the most positive outcome in reducing the caregiver burden and improving self-care.   

At the six-month follow-up, the rate of clinical depression was significantly lower among participants who received the intervention from those in the control group. Caregivers also reported that the intervention helped them feel more confident and able to deal with caring for their loved one, improved the care-recipient\'s quality of life and helped them keep the recipient at home.   

\""Medicine doesn\'t work in the same way across all races and ethnicities, or even from person-to-person,\"" said Burgio, the researcher in The University of Alabama\'s College of Arts and Sciences. \""Health professionals need to identify caregivers whose quality of life has been compromised and help them to get the help they need, for their sake and the sake of their loved ones.\""   

The study intervention was developed based on findings from the first phase of this study, Resources for Enhancing  Alzheimer\'s Caregiver Health (REACH) I , in which multiple caregiver interventions were studied to identify which were the most promising. In that study, researchers found that caregivers experienced similar problems at differing levels of intensity, and identified the need for developing an intervention that could be tailored to address the most troublesome problems for each individual caregiver.

A team from the University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre (CRCHUM) has discovered a novel link between chronic kidney disease and diabetes. When kidneys fail, urea that builds up in the blood can cause diabetes, concludes a study published today in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.

""We identified molecular mechanisms that may be responsible for increased blood glucose levels in patients with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease. Our observations in mice and in human samples show that the disease can cause secondary diabetes,"" said Dr. Vincent Poitout, researcher, CRCHUM Director, and principal investigator of the study.

Chronic kidney disease is characterized by the progressive and irreversible loss of kidney function in filtering and eliminating toxins from the blood. Eventually, those affected must undergo dialysis or kidney transplantation to eliminate toxins from their bloodstream.

It is well known that type 2 diabetes is one of the causes of chronic kidney disease. The nephrologist Laetitia Koppe, who has just completed a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Poitout's laboratory, has proven that the opposite is also true. ""About half of those affected by chronic kidney disease have abnormal blood sugar levels. I wondered why. We conducted experiments in mice and found impaired insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, as observed in diabetes. We observed the same abnormalities in samples of pancreatic cells from patients with chronic kidney disease,"" explained Dr. Koppe.

The researchers highlighted the surprisingly toxic role of urea, a nitrogenous waste product normally filtered by the kidneys and excreted in urine. ""In patients with chronic renal failure, the kidneys are no longer able to eliminate toxins. Urea is part of this cocktail of waste that accumulates in the blood. In nephrology textbooks, urea is presented as a harmless product. This study demonstrates the opposite, that urea is directly responsible for impaired insulin secretion in chronic kidney disease,"" argued Koppe.

At the heart of pancreatic beta cells, Drs. Koppe and Poitout identified a particular protein, called phosphofruktokinase 1. ""The function of this protein is altered by an increase in blood urea, which occurs in chronic kidney disease. Increased urea causes impaired insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells. This creates oxidative stress and excessive glycosylation of phosphofructokinase 1, which causes an imbalance of blood glucose and may progress to diabetes,"" said Dr. Poitout, who is also professor at the University of Montreal and the Canada Research Chair in Diabetes and Pancreatic Beta-Cell Function.

The study is important because it reveals a link and rather novel mechanism between chronic kidney disease and diabetes. ""Further studies are required to validate these findings in humans. But if our observations are confirmed, it will mean that patients with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease are at risk of developing diabetes. One might then suggest therapeutic approaches, such as taking antioxidants, which may protect pancreatic beta cells and reduce the risk of developing diabetes,"" said Dr. Poitout.",0

Individuals who have sleep-related breathing disorder appear significantly more likely to develop  depression , with odds of depression increasing as breathing disorders becomes more severe, according to a study in the September 18 issue of  Archives of Internal Medicine , a theme issue on sleep.
   
Frequent pauses in breathing, labored breathing or reduced breathing during the night are hallmark signs of sleep-related breathing disorder, according to background information in the article. The disorder has been linked to a variety of negative health consequences, including cardiovascular disease and difficulty functioning during the day. Previous studies have suggested that depression improves when sleep-related breathing disorder is treated, indicating that these two common conditions are related. Characterizing the relationship, the authors write, could ""guide screening for depressive symptoms in patient populations with sleep-related breathing disorder, suggest strategies for managing sleep-related breathing disorder-related depression and alert clinicians about the possibility of untreated depression complicating adherence to sleep-related breathing disorder mitigation strategies and treatments ....""
   
Paul E. Peppard, Ph.D., and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-Madison evaluated 1,408 adults (788 men, 620 women) who were between the ages of 30 and 60 at the beginning of the study, in 1988. The participants stayed overnight in a laboratory once every four years, during which time sleep was monitored with a test known as polysomnography and breathing disturbances were recorded. By May 2005, 449 participants had completed one sleep study, 382 completed two, 319 completed three and 258 completed four, for a total of 3,202 sleep studies. At each sleep study, body mass index was recorded and interviews and questionnaires completed by participants provided information about medical history, lifestyle habits, demographics and whether they had difficulty sleeping at night ( insomnia ) or felt sleepy during the day.
   
During the 3,202 sleep studies, 334 showed no evidence of reduced or paused breathing. Among cases of sleep-related breathing disorder, 1,911 were categorized as minimal, defined as an average of fewer than five incidences of reduced or paused breathing per hour; 606 were mild, with an average of five to 14 such events per hour; and 351 were moderate or worse, with 15 or more events per hour. About twice as many men as women had mild, moderate or worse sleep-related breathing disorder--14 percent of sleep studies among men revealed moderate sleep-related breathing disorder, vs. 6 percent of women. Throughout the study, there were 649 cases of mild depression and 392 of moderate or more severe depression. Women were about twice as likely to be depressed as men (27 percent vs. 15 percent).
   
Compared with patients without sleep-related breathing disorder, those with minimal cases of the condition were 1.6 times as likely to be depressed; those with mild cases, twice as likely; and those with moderate or worse, 2.6 times as likely. Individuals whose breathing problems worsened over time increased their risk for depression. ""Among these studies, an increase in sleep-related breathing disorder to the next higher category (for instance, from no sleep-related breathing disorder to minimal sleep-related breathing disorder) was associated with a 1.8-fold increased odds for development of depression compared with unchanging sleep-related breathing disorder,"" the authors write. ""For example, persons initially without sleep-related breathing disorder but in whom minimal sleep-related breathing disorder developed during a four-year period are estimated to be at 80 percent greater odds for development of depression than those who remain without sleep-related breathing disorder.""
   
""Our longitudinal findings of a dose-response association between sleep-related breathing disorder and depression provide evidence consistent with a causal link between these conditions and should heighten clinical suspicion of depression in those with sleep-related breathing disorder,"" they conclude.

Common mental disorders, such as  depression  and  anxiety , now account for more incapacity benefit claims than 

musculoskeletal conditions like low  back pain , say researchers in this week's BMJ.    
Long term sickness absence is a major public health and economic problem. In 2003, 176 million working days were lost; up 10 

million on the previous year. Each year, �13bn are spent on benefits, and the reduction of long term sick leave is now a top 

government priority.    
Until recently, the most common causes of long term sickness absence were musculoskeletal disorders, in particular low back 

pain, but over the last decade, the contribution of psychiatric disorders has increased markedly. Since 1995, the number of 

people reporting  stress  that was caused or made worse by their work has doubled, and common mental disorders are now the 

leading cause of sickness absence.    
These disorders are managed almost entirely in primary care, but with limited capacity for psychological therapies, waiting 

times are often long. The United Kingdom also has very poor provision of occupational physicians (one specialist for every 

43,000 workers) compared with the rest of Europe.    
Both employers and patients require a speedier response than is currently delivered, as the longer an individual remains off 

work, the more difficult a return becomes. 
If the government is serious about tackling the consequences of common mental disorders then innovative policies, including a 

major expansion in occupational health and psychological therapy services in primary care, will be required alongside 

research into the most effective and cost effective methods of delivering service, say the authors.    
This would be a wise investment given the substantial economic and social costs engendered by the current service framework, 

they conclude.

Dartmouth Medical School geneticists have discovered that DNA damage resets the cellular circadian clock, suggesting links among circadian timing, the cycle of cell division, and the propensity for  cancer .
   
Their work, reported June 29 in Science Express, the advance electronic publication of Science, implies a protective dimension for the biological clock in addition to its pacemaker functions that play such a sweeping role in the rhythms and activities of life.
   
\""The notion that the clock regulates DNA-damage input and that mutation can affect the clock as well as the cell cycle is novel,\"" says Jay Dunlap, professor and chair of genetics at DMS. \""It suggests a fundamental connection among circadian timing, cell cycle progress, and potentially the origins of some cancers.\""
   
Dunlap is a co-author of the paper with DMS colleagues, Jennifer Loros, professor of biochemistry, graduate student Christopher L. Baker, and former students António M. Pregueiro and Qiuyun Liu.
   
The team of Loros and Dunlap were among to first to delineate the intricate web of clockwork genes, proteins and feedback loops that drive circadian rhythms, working chiefly in the classic genetic model organism Neurospora, the common bread mold.
   
One gene (period-4) was identified over 25 years ago by a mutation that affects two clock properties, shortening the circadian period and altering temperature compensation. For this study, the researchers cloned the gene based on its position in the genome, and found it was an important cell cycle regulator. When they eliminated the gene from the genome, the clock was normal, indicating that the mutation interfered in some way with the clock, rather than supplying something that the clock normally needs to run.
   
Biochemically, the mutation results in a premature modification of the well understood clock protein, frequency (FRQ). The investigators demonstrated that this was a direct result of action by an enzyme, called in mammals checkpoint kinase-2 (CHK2), whose normal role is exclusively in regulating the cell division cycle. CHK2 physically interacts with FRQ; the mutation makes this interaction much stronger. However, a mutant enzyme that has lost its activity has no effect on the clock.
   
Normally CHK2 is involved in the signal response pathway that begins when DNA is damaged and results in a temporary stoppage of cell division until the damage is fixed. The researchers found that the resetting effect of DNA damage requires the period-4 clock protein, and that period-4 is the homolog, the Neurospora version, of the mammalian checkpoint kinase.
   
Moreover, the clock regulates expression of the period-4 gene. This closes a loop connecting the clock to period-4 and period-4 to the clock and the cell cycle. The clock normally modulates expression of this gene that encodes an important cell cycle regulator, and that cell cycle regulator in turn affects not only the cell cycle but also the clock.
   
Recent evidence in mammalian cells shows that other cell cycle regulators physically interact with clock proteins. Loss of at least one clock protein (mammalian period-2) is known to increase cancer susceptibility. The coordination of the clock and cell division through cell cycle checkpoints, supports the clock\'s \""integral role in basic cell biology,\"" conclude the researchers.\"" Their work can help advance understanding of cancer origins as well as the timing of anti-cancer treatment.

In contrast to 40 years ago, children born to older mothers today are more likely to perform better in cognitive ability tests than those born to younger mothers, reveals new research from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR).

This shift is due to the changing characteristics of women who have children at an older age, according to a paper published in the International Journal of Epidemiology.

Older mothers today tend to be more advantaged than younger mothers - for example, they are well educated, are less likely to smoke during pregnancy and are established in professional occupations. This was not necessarily true in the past.

Moreover, today an increasing number of women are having their first child at an older age and, on average, first-born children perform better on cognitive ability tests. This is possibly because they receive more resources and attention from parents than siblings born after them. In contrast, in the past, older mothers were likely to be giving birth to their third or fourth child.

Researchers analysed data from three UK longitudinal studies - the 1958 National Child Development Study, the 1970 British Cohort Study and the 2001 Millennium Cohort Study. Children's cognitive ability was tested when they were 10/11 years old.

In the 1958 and 1970 cohorts children born to mothers aged 25-29 scored higher than children born to mothers aged 35-39. In the 2001 cohort this result was reversed. Although the results were similar for the children born to mothers over 40, the sample was smaller which means the findings should be treated with caution.

When the researchers took the mothers' social and economic characteristics into account, the differences across cohorts disappeared. This indicates that the changing characteristics of women who have children at an older age were highly likely to be the reason for the cohort differences. 

Dr Alice Goisis, a researcher at LSE and the lead author of the paper, said: ""Our research is the first to look at how the cognitive abilities of children born to older mothers have changed over time and what might be responsible for this shift.

""It's essential to better understand how these children are doing given that, since the 1980s, there has been a significant increase in the average age of women having their first child in industrialised countries.

""Cognitive ability is important in and of itself but also because it is a strong predictor of how children fare in later life - in terms of their educational attainment, their occupation and their health.""

Humans are experts in facial perception. But not from birth. At which point do children become as skilled at it as adults?

Seven-year-olds show different brain activities than adults when it comes to facial perception. This is reported by the workgroup Developmental Neuropsychology in the Ruhr-Universität Bochum's science journal RUBIN. The results don't support the theory that brain areas that are specialised for facial perception are fully developed at the age of five.

Prof Dr Sarah Weigelt and Marisa Nordt compared habituation effects in adults and in children that occurred when viewing portrait photos. They recorded the brain activity in the so-called Fusiform Face Area using functional magnetic resonance imaging. If test participants are repeatedly presented with the same photo of a face, the brain activity in that brain region decreases. The habituation effect does not occur if the photos show different people. The researchers identified these results in children as well as in adults.

Differences became apparent when the psychologists presented the participants with several photos of the same person in quick succession. In adults, a habituation effect set in that wasn't as strong as the one occurring during viewing of identical photos of one person. The mean result for seven-year-olds was the same. ""A closer look reveals that the results in children were caused by a different factor,"" says Sarah Weigelt.

Together with her colleague, she analysed the data of individual test participants. If adults were shown different photos of the same person, a habitual effect set in that was less strong than when viewing identical photos of one person. While some children did not present any habituation effect at all, others presented a fully-developed one.

""If children see different photos of one and the same person, they appear to say either: this is the same person. Or: these are two different people,"" elaborates Weigelt. ""There is nothing in between."" The results thus illustrate that even though seven-year-olds are able to recognise faces, that skill is not fully developed yet.",1

A report in The Journal of the American Dental Association (JADA) shows that dental benefits play a significant role in meeting the dental needs of children, including checkups and treatments. The study is particularly timely as February is National Children's Dental Health Month.

The report finds U.S. children enrolled in private or public dental care plans were more likely to receive dental care than children who did not have coverage from 1997 to 2014. The study also showed that unmet dental needs of children who were enrolled in a dental care plan, private or public, steadily decreased from 2009 to 2014.

""The number of uninsured children decreased by 58 percent from 1997 to 2014 with a significant shift from private to public insurance coverage,"" stated authors Maryam Amin, D.M.D., M.S.c., Ph.D., Maryam Elyasi, D.D.S., and Zhou J. Yu, B.S.c. ""The shift toward use of public insurance along with a significant association between unmet needs and dental visits support the effectiveness of publicly funded programs in facilitating the use of dental services in the United States.""

The authors examined data from more than 65,000 participants collected by the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Dental needs are met by regular visits to the dentist and adequate access to dental care. According to the study, some barriers to receiving care include socioeconomic status, beliefs about dental care, and the accessibility of providers. Some enabling factors include level of education, household income, and dental insurance.

""If an imbalance exists between barriers and enabling factors, a patient may have a higher chance of having unmet dental needs because of cost, which leads to delayed diagnosis of issues, more complex treatment, and ultimately increased burden on public health systems,"" the authors stated.

195,273565,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315683.php,Study highlights importance of preventing weight gain in adults to reduce type 2 diabetes,Diabetes,Diabetes,Obesity / Weight Loss / Fitness,,,1,1,1,3,4,4,4,4,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,"
A study of over 33,000 people, published in the journal BMC Public Health, indicates that public health strategies that aim to prevent adult weight gain in the whole population have the potential to prevent twice as many cases of type 2 diabetes as strategies that target individuals at high risk of diabetes due to being obese.

Current clinical practice and public health programmes generally target those at high risk of type 2 diabetes, such as people who are obese (body mass index (BMI) over 30 kg/m2) and have higher than normal blood glucose. While there is evidence to show that these programmes are effective for the individuals who are targeted, their potential to impact the prevalence of diabetes in the whole population is limited.

There is less evidence concerning the impact of moderate weight loss or weight maintenance in adults across the whole population on the occurrence of type 2 diabetes. This study sought to determine the potential to reduce the occurrence of diabetes of strategies that aim to shift the distribution of body weight in the whole population.

The researchers from the VIPCAM collaboration between MRC Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge and the Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine at Umeå University analysed data from 33,184 people aged 30-60 years who attended two health examinations 10 years apart between 1990 and 2013 as part of the Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP). By analysing these data they were able to determine the association between change in body weight between baseline and 10 year follow-up and occurrence of newly diagnosed diabetes at 10 year follow-up, and assessed the impact of population-level shifts in body weight on the occurrence of diabetes. In their analysis they controlled for potential confounding factors, including sex, age, calendar year, family history of diabetes, tobacco use, education and marital status.

During 10 years of follow-up, 1,087 (3.3%) study participants developed diabetes, 17,876 (53.9%) study participants gained more than 1 kg/m2 relative to their starting weight (equivalent to 3 kg for an adult of average height in Sweden), and 12,020 (36.2%) maintained their weight (defined as change of less than ±1 kg/m2). Compared to those who maintained their weight, people who gained more than 1 kg/m2 had a 52% higher risk of diabetes (odds ratio (OR) 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-1.74).

The researchers estimated that if everyone who gained weight had maintained their weight, regardless of their starting weight (known as primary weight maintenance),  one in five of all type 2 diabetes cases in the population could have been prevented (population attributable fraction (PAF) 21.9%).

By contrast the researchers estimated, based on previous research, that if  everyone in the population at high risk of diabetes due to having a BMI over 30 kg/m2 was referred to a commercial weight management programme, only one in ten (PAF 8.2%) type 2 diabetes cases could be prevented.

Dr Adina Feldman, from the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge, who is first author on the paper said:

""We have shown that a population-based strategy that promotes prevention of weight gain in adulthood has the potential to prevent more than twice as many diabetes cases as a strategy that only promotes weight loss in obese individuals at high risk of diabetes. Thus, when it comes to body weight and diabetes, from a public health perspective it would be advisable to consider both high-risk and population-based strategies for diabetes prevention.""

The researchers caution that the modelling estimates should be interpreted carefully as they represent outcomes under idealised conditions, but they are useful to contrast the potential impact of different diabetes prevention strategies.

The number of cases of  kidney cancer  has been rising over the last two decades, and new research from the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center shows that this increase is driven largely by the detection of small, presumably curable, kidney masses. But even though the rising incidence has been paralleled by greater use of surgery for kidney cancer, this trend has not led to fewer people dying.
   
""With increased early detection and treatment of small tumors, we would expect to see a decrease in mortality associated with kidney cancer,"" says senior author Brent K. Hollenbeck, M.D., assistant professor of urology at the U-M Medical School. ""Surprisingly, that's not what we found. Our research shows that an increase in detection and treatment is not leading to a reduction in the kidney cancer mortality rate.""
   
The study - published in the Sept. 20 issue of the  Journal of the National Cancer Institute  - includes data from nine of the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries. In all, the researchers examined data from 34,503 patients with kidney cancer.
   
Over the study period (1983 to 2002), researchers observed a rise in the occurrence of kidney cancer (also known as renal cell carcinoma) for tumors of all sizes. But the greatest increases in kidney cancer incidence were among tumors 4 centimeters or smaller. Tumors of this size, often found in patients without any clinical signs or symptoms, are being detected more and more with the widespread use of abdominal imaging studies, such as MRIs and  CAT scans . These small kidney tumors are considered curable by surgery, which has led to a rise in surgery for kidney cancer.
   
Even as early detection and surgical treatment increased, however, mortality rates caused by kidney cancer during the time period rose dramatically, from 1.2 to 3.2 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States.
   
These seemingly contradictory findings can be explained, in part, through the rising incidence of larger, more lethal tumors, says lead author John M. Hollingsworth, M.D., fifth-year surgery resident with the Department of Urology at the U-M Medical School. ""While more and more small, detectable kidney tumors are being treated, the absolute number of patients with larger, lethal masses has not decreased. And it is these larger, lethal masses that seem to mainly affect mortality,"" Hollingsworth says.
   
The researchers say the data also suggest something else: A proportion of these smaller, incidentally found kidney tumors may not merit surgical removal.
   
""We're not saying that surgery for patients with small renal masses is inappropriate,"" Hollingsworth says. ""Our findings, however, show that their increased treatment has not diminished kidney cancer mortality. This calls to question the effectiveness of our current treatment strategy. Perhaps there are some patients with small kidney tumors for whom surgery is not the best option.""
   
Kidney cancer is the third most common malignancy of the genitourinary system (the reproductive system and urinary system). The American Cancer Society estimates there will be about 38,890 new cases of kidney cancer (24,650 in men and 14,240 in women) in the United States this year, and about 12,840 people (8,130 men and 4,710 women) will die from the disease.
   
This study included data from 34,503 kidney cancer patients, including age at diagnosis, race, gender and information about the  tumor . During the years 1983-2002, researchers found, the overall incidence of kidney cancer rose from 7.1 to 10.8 cases per 100,000 people in the United States, an increase of 52 percent. The largest increase was among people with tumors 2 to 4 centimeters in size (the second-smallest category of tumors in the study), an increase of 1.0 to 3.3 cases per 100,000 people in the United States.
   
Mortality rates also increased, most notably among people with the largest group of tumors (greater than 7 centimeters). Deaths caused by  cancer  in this group rose from 0.3 to 1.4 per 100,000 people in the United States.
   
""What this shows us is that, despite more frequent surgeries for smaller kidney cancers, mortality among patients with kidney cancer has continued to increase,"" Hollingsworth says. ""So even while detection and treatment are increasing and more tumors have become detectable, this study suggests a disconnect because we are not decreasing mortality rates.""

Statistics say that one out of six American men will develop  prostate cancer  and more than a third of them will experience a recurrence after undergoing treatment, putting them at high risk to die of the disease. In a recent study published in SAGE publication's Integrative Cancer Therapies, Dr. Gordon A. Saxe and colleagues at the Moores Cancer Center and School of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego found that diet changes, reinforced by  stress  management training, appeared to be effective in slowing or halting the spread of this deadly  cancer .
   
The study, published in the September issue of Integrative Cancer Therapies, focused on the change in the levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an indicator of the cancer, in response to a plant-based diet and stress reduction. Patients were taught to increase consumption of plant-based foods such as whole grains, cruciferous and leafy green vegetables, beans and legumes, and fruit, and to decrease the intake of meat, dairy products, and refined  carbohydrates . They were also provided with stress management training, which incorporated meditation,  yoga  and Tai Chi exercises. The plant-based diet and stress reduction were effective in significantly reducing the PSA rate, indicating a reduction in the rate of progression of the prostate cancer.
   
""The magnitude of effect of these findings is the strongest observed to date among dietary and nutritional interventions in this patient population,"" states Dr. Saxe, assistant professor of Family and Preventive Medicine. ""These results provide preliminary evidence that adoption of a plant-based diet, in combination with stress reduction, may attenuate disease progression and have therapeutic potential for management of recurrent prostate cancer.""

Acne is more than just a skincare concern. It can also be painful, persistent, and uncomfortable to the person who develops it.


While prescription and other medicinal treatments can work, they may also contain harsh ingredients that can dry out the surrounding skin. Those looking for more natural remedies or for something that will clean the skin more deeply may turn to mask applications.

One such mask that is rumored to treat acne is made from honey and cinnamon. While there are some things to bear in mind when creating this mask, the treatment can be very soothing and work well as a cleanser. 

Contents of this article:

Honey is a solution that is made from sugar, mostly fructose and glucose. These sugars contain proteins, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and enzymes.

For centuries, people have used honey as a medicinal treatment. The compound has been used to treat dandruff, psoriasis, burns, and fungal infections. Honey is also added to many skincare products.   

The main reason for using honey and cinnamon to treat  acne is because it can help to kill the bacteria that contribute to inflamed pores.

The Proionibacterium acnes or P. acnes bacteria have been found in many red and inflamed pimples. The bacteria feed on sebum, which is the waxy substance that can build up and clog pores, further contributing to acne. 

Honey has several chemical properties that enable it to kill bacteria. Examples include:

Cinnamon also has antimicrobial properties. According to an article in the International Journal of Pharmaceutical Science Invention, cinnamon can kill or suppress the E. coli, Staphylococcus, and Candida albican microbes.

Cinnamon also has astringent properties. Astringents help to shrink pores, which can make the skin appear smoother and more even. 

The benefits of using honey and cinnamon together as a face mask haven't really been studied. The two have been separately studied, but the research is mixed on whether or not they are effective.

A study published in BMJ Open investigated the application of a 90 percent medical-grade kanuka honey and 10 percent glycerine (honey-derived) treatment after washing the face with an antibacterial soap compared with washing the face with the same soap, but not applying the honey.

The researchers concluded that adding the honey combination to the acne regimen only improved 4 out of 53 patients' acne.

Another review looked at 70 articles about cinnamon and found that cinnamon has antimicrobial properties as well as wound-healing properties. The researchers also suggested that cinnamon may have anti-aging properties in the skin.   

A review published in the Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine found that honey contains enzymes that create hydrogen peroxide, which has antimicrobial properties.

However, not all honey types have this property. An example is Manuka honey. However, Manuka honey still displays antimicrobial effects because it has a low pH level and high sugar content. 

An article published in the Journal of Microbiology, Immunology, and Infection found that some types of honey from Iran had as much antimicrobial activity as certain antibiotics. However, the study's authors pointed out honey hasn't been studied as widely for its ability to kill the P. acnes bacteria that tend to thrive in pimples. 

Like many natural treatments, honey and cinnamon as a skincare remedy hasn't been widely researched. People seeing a dermatologist for their acne should always check with them before using the cinnamon and acne mask to ensure it won't affect current treatments used. 

Some people who opt to make a face mask with cinnamon and honey will leave it on their skin for 30 minutes.

Others will use the mask as more of a ""spot treatment,"" applying it as a paste to pimples and acne blemishes. The options are truly up to the user, their skin concerns, and their skin type.

People intending to make a face mask can take the following steps:

One consideration is what type of honey to use. Medicinal-grade honeys are available at many health foods stores. These honeys have been purified and are generally free of additives. They are often the compounds used in skincare applications.

Two examples of medicinal-grade honey brands include Manuka honey and Revamil honey.

Some people prefer to use local honey, which is honey produced by honeybee farmers in their area. The idea behind using local honey is that it has compounds that may fight off illness when ingested. Some people will eat spoonfuls of local honey as a means to fight allergies. 

Honey is often safe when applied to the skin. It is possible that a person may have an allergic reaction to honey, however. Examples of allergic side effects can include hives, itching, swelling, and wheezing. 

Cinnamon can also be highly irritating to the skin. For this reason, it is important to always use a test patch on the hand before applying the honey and cinnamon face mask to the entire face.

When it comes to treating acne, the goals are to keep the skin clean, moisturized, and free of pore-clogging oils and bacteria without over-drying the skin.

Many natural treatments for acne exist that can be used in addition to honey and cinnamon masks. Examples include:

An acne treatment plan can include the following steps:

Many people cannot control their acne with over-the-counter products. In this instance, they may need to see a dermatologist for a prescription for stronger medications that can fight acne blemishes.

Adult Americans who regularly consumed sugar-sweetened beverages (roughly one can of soda per day) had a 46 percent higher risk of developing prediabetes compared to low- or non-consumers over a 14-year period, according to a new epidemiological analysis led by scientists at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts University. Higher sugar-sweetened beverage intake was also associated with increased insulin resistance, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.

No associations between diet soda consumption and risk of prediabetes or increased insulin resistance were found. However, the research team notes that previous studies on associations between diet soda and risk of type 2 diabetes have produced mixed results, and further studies are needed to reveal the long-term health impact of artificially sweetened drinks. The findings were published in the Journal of Nutrition.

""Although our study cannot establish causality, our results suggest that high sugar-sweetened beverage intake increases the chances of developing early warning signs for type 2 diabetes. If lifestyle changes are not made, individuals with prediabetes are on the trajectory to developing diabetes,"" said senior study author Nicola McKeown, Ph.D., scientist in the Nutritional Epidemiology Program at the USDA HNRCA.

""Our findings support recommendations to limit sugar-sweetened beverage intake, which can be achieved by replacing sugary beverages with healthier alternatives such as water or unsweetened coffee or tea,"" added McKeown, who is also an associate professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts. ""This is a simple dietary modification that could be of substantial health benefit to people who consume sugary drinks daily and who are at increased risk of diabetes.""

In the current study, McKeown and her colleagues analyzed longitudinal data on 1,685 middle-aged adults over a period of 14 years, obtained from the Framingham Heart Study's Offspring cohort - a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded program that has monitored multiple generations for lifestyle and clinical characteristics that contribute to cardiovascular disease. Selected participants did not have diabetes or prediabetes during an initial baseline examination and self-reported their long-term sugar-sweetened beverage and diet soda consumption habits through food frequency questionnaires. Sugar-sweetened beverages were defined as colas and other carbonated beverages, and non-carbonated fruit drinks such as lemonade and fruit punch. Fruit juice was not included in the sugar-sweetened beverage category.

The team found those who drank the highest amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages - a median of six 12 fluid ounce servings a week - had a significantly greater risk of developing prediabetes compared to low- or non-consumers, after adjusting for factors such as age, sex and body mass index. The highest consumers of sugar-sweetened beverages had roughly 8 percent higher insulin resistance scores, compared to low- or non-consumers after follow-up at seven years. Even after accounting for change in weight and other aspects of diet, the relationships between sugar-sweetened beverages and these metabolic risk factors for diabetes persisted.

Diet soda intake - defined as low-calorie cola or other carbonated low-calorie beverages - had no statistical associations with risk for either prediabetes or insulin resistance. However, previous research on the relationship between diet soda and type 2 diabetes has been mixed, and it is still unclear whether any observed associations are due to direct or indirect factors. More research is needed to determine whether there are real health risks with long-term diet soda consumption, say the study authors. In addition, the authors caution that despite adjusting for multiple factors, residual confounding cannot be ruled out due to the observational nature of the study. Participants who were analyzed in the study were mostly middle-aged and Caucasian, more likely to be women, and had lower body mass index and waist circumference, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.

A significant body of research has found associations between regular consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The new findings now provide evidence of an association with the major predictor of type 2 diabetes. If diagnosed early, prediabetes is reversible through lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise.

""Based on our observational study alone, we cannot be certain why we saw the relationships we did. Additional studies are needed to fully understand the health impact of sugar-sweetened beverages and diet sodas,"" said lead study author Jiantao Ma, Ph.D., who conducted the analysis as part of his doctoral thesis as a student in the Nutrition Epidemiology Program at the USDA HNRCA and the Friedman School.

""Nevertheless, our data are consistent with many other studies and clinical trials that support the health benefits of reducing sugar intake, and we encourage the public to look for healthier options,"" added Ma, who is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health.

The study was supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health's Framingham Heart Study (award N01HC25195), Boston University School of Medicine and the United States Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service.

Adding a medication to a standard treatment regimen for major depressive disorder in the elderly improves chances of recovery in those who do not adequately respond to the first-course therapy or who relapse from it, finds a University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine study published in the June issue of the  American Journal of Psychiatry , the official journal of the American Psychiatric Association. Up to 84 percent of the elderly who experience  depression  either fail to respond to first-course treatment or relapse during the first six to 12 weeks of treatment.
   
The study found that adding a second drug to the treatment of depressed participants over the age of 70 who either did not respond to initial treatment with the  antidepressant  paroxetine and interpersonal psychotherapy, or to those who responded to the initial treatment but quickly relapsed, caused the likelihood of recovery to rise from 40 percent to 60 percent. Recovery was slower in those who did not respond to the original treatment.
   
""Depression should not be considered a normal part of aging. The scientific evidence is growing that there are a number of effective treatment options available for people of all ages,"" said Mary Amanda Dew, Ph.D., professor of psychiatry, psychology and epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh and lead author of the study.
   
The University of Pittsburgh researchers followed 105 adults aged 70 or older who had major depressive disorder and who did not respond to standardized treatment of paroxetine and interpersonal psychotherapy or who did respond but experienced an early recurrence of depressive symptoms. Participants were given one of three augmenting agents: sustained-release bupropion, nortriptyline or lithium. Researchers selected the additional agent that each participant received based on individual medical status and history. Thirty-six participants either declined new medicine or did not receive augmentation because of accompanying medical conditions.
   
Half of the patients who did not respond to the initial treatment responded to the augmentation therapy. It took a median 28 weeks for the participants to achieve recovery. Of the patients who relapsed after the initial therapy, 67 percent recovered after augmentation over a median recovery time of 24 weeks. Of the patients who responded to the first-course therapy of paroxetine and psychotherapy, 87 percent achieved recovery.
   
""While the recovery rates of those receiving augmentation are not as high as in those who responded to first-line therapy, the recovery rates are still high enough to suggest that augmentation should be tried when older adults' depression is not improving,"" said Dr. Dew.

Campaigns to promote physical activity and reduce obesity among children should focus more on active outdoor play, according to a study led at the University of Strathclyde.

The Active Healthy Kids Scotland Report Card 2016 has found that children's physical activity levels are continuing to fall well short of recommended levels.

By contrast, they are still spending far more than the recommended maximum of two hours' free time a day in front of screens.

The researchers have proposed that strategies to promote physical activity and reduce screen time should place a higher emphasis on playing actively outdoors, something children could potentially do 365 days a year.

The 2016 Report Card, entitled Unplug & Play, has been produced by the University of Strathclyde with the University of Aberdeen.

Professor John Reilly, of Strathclyde's School of Psychological Sciences and Health, led the study. He said: ""The amount of time children spend in front of screens has had an impact on their wellbeing for many years. The popularity of computer games and the emergence of the internet, smartphones, and social media have contributed further to this problem.

""Physical activity among children in Scotland is below the levels they require, not only for short- and long-term health and wellbeing but also for their academic attainment. In fact, the time they spend at screens - far more than is recommended - is harmful to their health and academic attainment.

""There are a number of promising policies in place in Scotland to deal with this problem but we propose a new focus on active and outdoor play. Past and current public health strategies have been very much built around the school day, on commuting to school, break time and PE lessons but, while these are important approaches, they do not take account of all the time children spend outside school (at least 160 days a year)-children should be playing outdoors more often.

""Play benefits children in helping them to develop socially and emotionally, so promoting active outdoor play would have many benefits in addition to improving physical activity, improving academic attainment, and reducing obesity.""

A new study finds that drinking carbonated soft drinks is not linked to esophageal  cancer  or cancer of the cardia, the place where the stomach and esophagus meet.
   
Jesper Lagergren, M.D., of Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, and colleagues examined data from 189 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, 262 patients with cardia adenocarcinoma, and 820 controls. The patients were interviewed about their previous carbonated drink consumption.
   
The authors found that drinking carbonated soft drinks or low-alcohol beer was not associated with increased risk of esophageal or cardia adenocarcinoma. ""This study gives no support for the hypothesis that the use of carbonated soft drinks contributes to the increasing incidence of this cancer,"" they write.

A new study indicates that the chemical in cannabis that makes us stoned, delta-9-tetrahydrocannibol, might also protect us from  cancer .  According to researchers, delta-9-tetrahydrocannibol is able to halt the spread of gamma  herpes  viruses.    
Gamma herpes viruses have been shown to increase one's chances of developing Kaposis Sarcoma, Burkitts  lymphoma  and Hodgkins disease.    
You can read about this latest study in the journal BMC Medicine.  The study was carried out by researchers at the University of South Florida.    
Once a person is infected with the Gamma herpes virus, he/she has it for life - it is virtually impossible to get rid of it.  The Gamma herpes viruses are completely different from the herpes simplex virus.  Gamma herpes viruses lie dormant inside our white blood cells for many years.    
Unfortunately, the virus can suddenly become active and start reproducing.  As soon as this happens it starts invading other cells, increasing the chances of cancer developing.    
The researchers found that delta-9-tetrahydrocannibol stopped the sudden reactivation of gamma herpes viruses.    
The researchers found that mice died when the virus became reactivated.  However, the mice which had been injected with delta-9-tetrahydrocannibol survived and did not develop cancer.    
Delta-9-tetrahydrocannibol has no effect on the herpes simplex-1 virus, the one associated with  cold sores .    
This discovery could lead to the development of new cancer busting drugs.    
Dr Peter Medveczky said that if a person already has cancer caused by gamma herpes viruses he/she should not start smoking cannabis.  The chemical is preventative, not curative. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannibol also weakens your immune system.  He also added that these are very preliminary results - much more research is needed. ",0

Children with autism and other similar conditions often have difficulties in several areas of communication. A new doctoral thesis in linguistics from the University of Gothenburg shows that these children can develop speech, gestures and a sense of rhythm and melody by listening to various speech sounds.

It is well-known that children with autism, Asperger's syndrome, atypical autism and childhood disintegrative disorder (collectively referred to as autism spectrum condition, ASC) often have problems with gestures and the rhythm and melody of speech, yet studies in these areas remain scarce.

One reason for studying the sound structure of speech is that the development in this domain takes place during early childhood when we learn to distinguish between the different speech sounds and syllables in the speech stream. This is often problematic in children with ASC, since they may find it difficult to sort sensory impressions, to listen and see and experience their bodies simultaneously. In addition, some sensory impressions can be perceived to be particularly strong.

Children with ASC often have a good sense for details, and focusing on practising of sounds and syllables can therefore be used to achieve an interaction and to develop other linguistic areas.

'We wanted to find out whether an intervention focusing on typical traits of children with ASC could be used to develop various linguistic skills, such as syllables and sentence construction as well as intonation and gestures,' says Pia Nordgren, author of the thesis.

Nordgren followed two Swedish boys with ASC in three different studies. Minimal word pairs where only one speech sound differs between the words, for example p-b, were gradually introduced in order to increase the awareness of phonemic contrasts and symbolic representations of words. The results point to a temporal relationship between the phonological structure, the melody of speech and gestures. She also shows that auditory and visual perception can be an important precursor for language development in children with ASC. When the children listen and observe, there is a potential for development of interaction via speech and gestures.

The hypothesis behind the thesis is based on theories about the human brain. The idea is that the areas of the brain responsible for the recognition and production of speech are stimulated by the listening and can therefore lead to the development of sound production in general, and also to more advanced syllable constructions and the use of new words. This could also affect the melody of speech, gestures and other areas of the child's language.

'It also turned out that the children showed evidence of development in terms of the melody of speech, even though this was not an objective of the intervention. One child also developed his use of gestures, despite the fact that no direct training had been provided in this regard,' says Nordgren.

The results of the thesis support the notion of a mechanism in the brain (for example mirror neurons) that bridges the perception and production of speech. They also show that speech and gestures interact and that there is a strong relationship between them. Furthermore, it may be that children with ASC are aided by their hand movements in their development of language and speech.

'Further results indicate that children with ASC with very delayed speech may develop their speech as late as at age five. Thus, the method can be beneficial in interventions involving these kids and can also form a basis for further linguistic studies in the area,' says Nordgren.",0

What should healthy young men who want to watch their weight and manage their blood sugar levels drink? Can they risk something sugary or will they be hungrier after drinking calorie-free options containing natural or artificial non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS)? A new study published in Springer Nature's International Journal of Obesity shows that it doesn't really matter whether such drinks contain sugar, Stevia, monk fruit or aspartame. In the end, things even out in how the body reacts to these four options in terms of overall energy intake and the levels of glucose and insulin in the blood, says lead author Siew Ling Tey of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in Singapore. This is of interest given the growing popularity of natural plant-derived products, and the need to find out whether natural non-nutritive sweeteners are healthier than sugar or an artificial non-nutritive sweetener.

The effect of four different drinks was tested: one contained sugar (sucrose), another the artificial non-nutritive sweetener aspartame and two others the natural NNS made from either the plants Stevia (Rebaudioside A) or monk fruit (Mogroside V). These are the only two natural non-nutritive sweeteners approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, along with six other NNS including aspartame.

In this short term study, thirty healthy male study participants randomly consumed one of the four sweetened drinks on each of the different days of the investigation. On each test day, participants ate a standardized breakfast, and by mid-morning received one test beverage to tide them over until lunch. An hour later they were provided with a lunchtime meal and asked to eat until comfortably full. Their blood glucose and insulin concentrations were measured closely, while participants also kept a food diary of what they ate for the rest of the day.

Tey describes the findings as ""surprising"". There was no difference in the total daily energy intake across all four treatments, meaning that overall participants consumed the same amount of energy (calories) during the course of a day. They either reduced meal intake after the sucrose-sweetened drink or ate significantly more at lunchtime and the rest of the day to compensate for the three calorie-free drink options.

People sometimes worry that using non-nutritive sweeteners could increase their appetite, which may then lead them to overeat to make up for the energy they saved by not choosing sugar. The current study found that although participants felt slightly hungrier and looked forward more to eating something again when they drank non-nutritive sweetened beverages, they did not overindulge. They did however eat more following the NNS drinks than when they consumed the sugar sweetened drink.

""The energy 'saved' from replacing sugar with non-nutritive sweetener was fully compensated for at subsequent meals in the current study, hence no difference in total daily energy intake was found between the four treatments,"" explains Tey. ""It appears that the source of non-nutritive sweeteners, whether artificial or natural, does not differ in its effects on energy intake, postprandial glucose and insulin,"" says Tey. However, a recent comprehensive meta-analysis of longer term studies has demonstrated that when non-nutritive sweeteners are consumed over time there is a sustained reduction in overall energy intake and it reduces body weight.

Australian researchers have discovered remarkable evolutionary changes to insulin regulation in two of the nation's most iconic native animal species - the platypus and the echidna - which could pave the way for new treatments for type 2 diabetes in humans.

The findings, now published in the Nature journal Scientific Reports, reveal that the same hormone produced in the gut of the platypus to regulate blood glucose is also surprisingly produced in their venom.

The research is led by Professor Frank Grutzner at the University of Adelaide and Associate Professor Briony Forbes at Flinders University.

The hormone, known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), is normally secreted in the gut of both humans and animals, stimulating the release of insulin to lower blood glucose.

But GLP-1 typically degrades within minutes.

In people with type 2 diabetes, the short stimulus triggered by GLP-1 isn't sufficient to maintain a proper blood sugar balance. As a result, medication that includes a longer lasting form of the hormone is needed to help provide an extended release of insulin.

""Our research team has discovered that monotremes - our iconic platypus and echidna - have evolved changes in the hormone GLP-1 that make it resistant to the rapid degradation normally seen in humans,"" says co-lead author Professor Frank Grutzner, from the University of Adelaide's School of Biological Sciences and the Robinson Research Institute.

""We've found that GLP-1 is degraded in monotremes by a completely different mechanism. Further analysis of the genetics of monotremes reveals that there seems to be a kind of molecular warfare going on between the function of GLP-1, which is produced in the gut but surprisingly also in their venom,"" he says.

The platypus produces a powerful venom during breeding season, which is used in competition among males for females.

""We've discovered conflicting functions of GLP-1 in the platypus: in the gut as a regulator of blood glucose, and in venom to fend off other platypus males during breeding season. This tug of war between the different functions has resulted in dramatic changes in the GLP-1 system,"" says co-lead author Associate Professor Briony Forbes, from Flinders University's School of Medicine.

""The function in venom has most likely triggered the evolution of a stable form of GLP-1 in monotremes. Excitingly, stable GLP-1 molecules are highly desirable as potential type 2 diabetes treatments,"" she says.

Professor Grutzner says: ""This is an amazing example of how millions of years of evolution can shape molecules and optimise their function.

""These findings have the potential to inform diabetes treatment, one of our greatest health challenges, although exactly how we can convert this finding into a treatment will need to be the subject of future research.""

GLP-1 has also been discovered in the venom of echidnas. But while the platypus has spurs on its hind limbs for delivering a large amount of venom to its opponent, there is no such spur on echidnas.

""The lack of a spur on echidnas remains an evolutionary mystery, but the fact that both platypus and echidnas have evolved the same long-lasting form of the hormone GLP-1 is in itself a very exciting finding,"" Professor Grutzner says.

Scientists have moved a step closer to understanding how  breast cancer  spreads to other parts of the body, thanks to research published this week.
   
The University of Manchester team has discovered a protein potentially involved in the spread or \""metastatic progression\"" of tumors.
   
The researchers believe their findings could lead to new approaches to treating breast cancer as blocking the protein\'s actions has the potential to stop cancerous cells migrating.
   
\""What we have identified is a new role for a protein called LPP,\"" explained Professor Andrew Sharrocks, who headed the research team.
   
\""Until now, this protein was only thought to function at the cell periphery but we have shown that it works in conjunction with another protein - PEA3 - in the cell nucleus.
   
\""PEA3 has already been implicated in the spread of breast cancer but we have found that the LPP molecule is essential for the correct function of PEA3.\""
   
\""If we can target the LPP protein and stop it from working in cancerous cells, we have a possible new route to therapy.\""
   
The research, published in the scientific journal Molecular and Cellular Biology, may have implications for other  cancer  systems.
   
\""Benign tumours remain in one part of the body and are relatively easy to treat through surgery,\"" said Professor Sharrocks, who is based in the University\'s Faculty of Life Sciences.
   
\""But metastases - malignant cancers that spread to other parts of the body - can be much more problematic.
   
\""Our research is potentially fundamental to all types of cancers and has the potential to offer alternative therapies to stop cancers spreading to other organs in the body.\""
   
News of the scientific breakthrough comes as the University announced Breast Cancer Campaign funding for two other research projects worth nearly ?300,000.
   
Dr. Andrew Gilmore, also in the Faculty of Life Sciences, has been awarded a grant of ?146,000 to examine in more detail a process called \""anoikis.\""
   
Anoikis is the process whereby the body ambushes and kills roving cells that have gone \""AWOL\"" and are moving around the body without permission - like breast-cancer cells that spread from the breast to form tumours in other parts of the body.
   
Current breast-cancer treatments have been designed to kick start the anoikis process and kill these rogue cells. But the cancer cells are clever and learn how to avoid being destroyed, which means these treatments no longer work and patients often see their breast cancer return.
   
Dr. Gilmore said: \""Understanding more about how the body\'s natural defences work and why breast-cancer cells can avoid them will help develop new drugs that can kill invasive cells that have become resistant to standard treatment.\""
   
A further ?143,000 has been awarded by the charity to Dr Keith Brennan, again in Life Sciences, to uncover how a group of proteins called Notch are able to protect breast-cancer cells from dying.
   
\""Notch proteins appear to shield breast-cancer cells from the body\'s natural defences and also from being destroyed by  chemotherapy ,\"" said Dr. Brennan.
   
\""This research will help to uncover exactly how Notch proteins have this effect and whether inhibiting their action may be one way of making chemotherapy treatments more effective.\""
   
Pamela Goldberg, Chief Executive of Breast Cancer Campaign, added: \""The spread of breast-cancer cells to other areas of the body is the single most important factor in breast-cancer mortality.
   
\""When breast-cancer cells become invasive they become less responsive to treatment and the disease becomes more difficult for a clinician to manage.
   
\""Both these studies could help to develop new drugs which kill breast-cancer cells before they have an opportunity to spread.\""

The study shows that the appetite hormone CART not only controls the sensation of satiety, but it also helps increase insulin secretion and decrease glucagon production.

CART (Cocaine and Amphetamine-Regulated Transcript) is a hormone that has mainly been studied in the brain's centre for appetite control.

The research group behind the new study made the previously unknown discovery that CART can also be found in human alpha and beta cells located in the pancreas, and that cells from people with type 2 diabetes contain more CART than cells in people who are healthy.

""The high glucose levels could be what triggers the production of CART"", says Nils Wierup.

The study also shows that CART increases the effect of GLP-1, an intestinal hormone that lowers blood sugar levels. GLP-1 represents the basis of the latest drugs against type 2 diabetes by stimulating the body's own insulin production.

Nils Wierup says that the new discoveries can eventually lead to new drugs against type 2 diabetes. However, because CART is currently only available for research purposes, the active molecule of the hormone needs to be further developed to create the equivalent effect artificially. Furthermore, the receptor that binds to the molecule is still unknown.

""However, we believe that we're getting close"", says Nils Wierup and continues: ""Once we find the unknown receptor, we hope to explain the biological mechanisms behind CART's function, which will hopefully lead to new and better drugs.""

For many years, researchers believed that  stem cells  in the  bone marrow  spent most of their existence in a slumber-like state, unaware of -- and unaffected by -- the daily battles fought by the body\'s immune system.
   
Not so.
   
Scientists at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation have discovered that marrow stem cells -- undifferentiated cells that eventually give rise to the blood cells that fight infection -- possess receptors that recognize bacteria and viruses. When activated, these receptors kick the stem cells and immature blood cells into action, enlisting them to help fight whatever pathogen is attacking the body.
   
The findings, which appear in the June issue of the journal Immunity, could have important implications for treating leukemias and autoimmune diseases such as  lupus  and  rheumatoid arthritis .
   
\""We have long known that so-called hematopoietic (blood) stem cells create the blood cells that are the front-line soldiers in the body\'s immune system,\"" said Paul Kincade, Ph.D., the senior author on the paper. \""But we did not believe that infectious agents played an active role in the process.\""
   
\""What we have now discovered is that these stem cells have a sort of antennae that detect bacteria and viruses,\"" continued the OMRF researcher. \""And when stem cells receive these distress signals, they spring to action, creating cells the body most needs early in life-threatening situations.\""
   
This messaging system normally serves as an effective means of quickly replacing cells that are damaged or killed while keeping us healthy. But investigators suspect that the system also can be detrimental in certain circumstances -- for example, in  leukemia  patients that are vulnerable to infections after receiving bone marrow or cord blood transplants or in autoimmune diseases like lupus, where immunosuppressive treatments often leave the body subject to long-term infection.
   
Scientists need to study stem cells and leukemia cells in these diseases to determine if they are using this messaging system,\"" said Kincade.
   
Another key, he said, will be to figure out how best to control the receptors in stem cells. \""It may be possible to boost immunity when necessary and also shut down inappropriate responses. That could provide a powerful tool to fight  cancer , lupus and many other diseases.\""
   
###
   
The research, which was led by Kincade and Yoshinori Nagai, Ph.D., was conducted using purified stem cells obtained from the bone marrow of laboratory mice. This type of stem cells, possessed by humans of all ages, are not to be confused with embryonic stem cells, which are found only in early-stage embryos.
   
Done in collaboration with researchers at the University of Tokyo, Osaka University and Saga University (Japan), the research was supported by grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.
   
Kincade heads the Immunobiology and Cancer Research Program at OMRF, where he holds the William H. and Rita Bell Chair in Biomedical Research. A former president of both the American Association of Immunologists and the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, his laboratory focuses on understanding the development and function of cells in the immune system.

Parents need help to talk to their children about  cancer , say researchers in a study published online by the BMJ.
   
Cancer is relatively common among women of childbearing age. Although the importance of communication with patients and their families has been recognised, relatively little has been published about communication with children when their parent is newly diagnosed as having cancer.
   
To explore how children are affected by  breast cancer  in the family, researchers in Oxford interviewed 37 mothers with early breast cancer and 31 of their children aged between 6 and 18 years.
   
They found that, even before their mother\'s diagnosis, children were much more aware of cancer as a life threatening illness than their parents and other adults realised.
   
The main sources of their information were television soap operas, health campaigns, and celebrities, as well as direct experience of relatives or friends\' parents with cancer.
   
Parents sometimes misunderstood their children\'s reactions and underestimated the emotional impact or did not recognise the children\'s need for more preparation and information about the illness and its treatment.
   
Parents are often unaware how much their children know and, often reeling from the diagnosis themselves, may not be in the best position to decide what and how to tell their children, say the authors.
   
As part of their care, parents newly diagnosed with a life threatening illness need to be supported to think about how they will talk to their children, say the authors. General practitioners, hospital specialists, and nurses are well placed to help with these concerns, and if necessary to be involved in discussions with the children, they add.
   
Further work is also needed to develop and evaluate information for children of parents with cancer about cancer and its treatments, they conclude.

Breast  cancer  survivors\' beliefs about what may have caused their cancer are connected to whether they make healthy lifestyle changes after a cancer diagnosis. This is the finding of a research study appearing in the August 2006 issue of Psycho-Oncology by researchers at The Miriam Hospital and Brown Medical School.
   
\""We found that  breast cancer  survivors who believed that an unhealthy behavior - such as consuming an unhealthy diet, contributed to their cancer - were more likely to say that they had changed that behavior since their diagnosis,\"" says lead author Carolyn Rabin, PhD, a psychologist at The Miriam Hospital\'s Centers for Behavioral and Preventive Medicine. \""Likewise, breast cancer survivors who believed that a healthy behavior- such as consuming a healthy diet, could ward off a cancer recurrence - were more likely to say that they had adopted that behavior since their diagnosis.\""
   
Due to advances in detection and treatment, there are now more than 10 million Americans who are cancer survivors, according to the American Cancer Society. However, researchers have not yet determined why some cancer survivors are motivated by a cancer diagnosis to make healthy lifestyle changes, while others are not. This question prompted the study by researchers at The Miriam Hospital and Brown Medical School.
   
The researchers cite evidence from past studies indicating that many cancer survivors are not leading healthy lifestyles f{ 50 percent of breast cancer survivors consume fewer than the recommended five servings of fruits and vegetables per day, 23 percent consume more than 30 percent of their  calories  from fat, and 28 to 43 percent lead sedentary lifestyles. In addition, more than 50 percent of cancer survivors who smoked prior to diagnosis continue to smoke.
   
\""Adopting a healthy lifestyle is an important strategy for cancer survivors since, in addition to a cancer recurrence, they may be at increased risk for the developing other medical problems, such as cardiac or pulmonary disease, as a result of their cancer treatment. The goal of this study was to develop a better understanding of why a cancer diagnosis appears to serve as an impetus for some survivors to adopt healthy behaviors, while others do not,\"" says Rabin.
   
Researchers assessed breast cancer survivors within three months of the survivor completing all surgery,  chemotherapy , and/or radiation treatment for cancer and a second time three months later. Study participants completed measures assessing beliefs about the cause of their cancer; beliefs about behavioral strategies that may reduce the chance of cancer recurrence; diet, exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption; and any changes in health practices since their cancer diagnosis.
   
Findings indicated that survivors who believed that unhealthy diet, insufficient exercise or alcohol consumption contributed to their cancer were more likely to modify the relevant behavior. The most robust relationship between beliefs and behavior change was found for changes in diet.
   
\""This study suggests that cancer survivors develop their own understanding of the causes of their cancer and the behavior changes that may prevent recurrence, and then take an active problem-solving approach to help reduce risk of a future cancer,\"" says co-author Bernardine Pinto, PhD, a psychologist at The Miriam Hospital\'s Centers for Behavioral and Preventive Medicine.
   
Given the role of health behavior changes in reducing medical risks, these findings have important implications for maintaining the health of cancer survivors. The authors note, however, that even though survivors\' beliefs about what caused their cancer may prompt healthy lifestyle changes, these beliefs may not be accurate.
   
\""This research highlights the important role that survivors\' beliefs about their disease have in their life post-cancer diagnosis. Ultimately, we hope that cancer survivors will take a holistic approach to maintaining their health so that they do not dismiss an opportunity to make a healthy lifestyle change. Behavior modification may not impact their chance of a cancer recurrence, but can help reduce other serious medical risks,\"" says Rabin.

Now new findings reveal that this bilingualism-related difference in brain activity is evident as early as 11 months of age, just as babies are on the verge of producing their first words.

""Our results suggest that before they even start talking, babies raised in bilingual households are getting practice at tasks related to executive function,"" said Naja Ferjan Ramírez, lead author and a research scientist at the Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences (I-LABS) at the University of Washington.

""This suggests that bilingualism shapes not only language development, but also cognitive development more generally,"" she said.

The study also gives evidence that the brains of babies from bilingual families remain more open to learning new language sounds, compared with babies from monolingual families.

The study was published online April 4 in Developmental Science and will appear in an upcoming issue of the journal.

""Monolingual babies show a narrowing in their perception of sounds at about 11 months of age - they no longer discriminate foreign-language sounds they successfully discriminated at 6 months of age,"" said co-author Patricia Kuhl, co-director of I-LABS.

""But babies raised listening to two languages seem to stay 'open' to the sounds of novel languages longer than their monolingual peers, which is a good and highly adaptive thing for their brains to do,"" Kuhl said.

The researchers used magnetoencephalography (MEG), which measures magnetic changes given off by active nerve cells. Unlike other brain-imaging methods, MEG can precisely pinpoint both the timing and location of activity in the brain.

The study is the first to use MEG to do whole-brain analyses comparing activation patterns in response to speech sounds in babies raised in monolingual and bilingual households.

In the experiment, 16 11-month-old babies - eight from English-only households and eight from Spanish-English households, and an even mix of demographic factors such as the family's socioeconomic status - sat in a highchair beneath the helmet-like MEG scanner.

The babies listened to an 18-minute stream of speech sounds, such as ""da's"" and ""ta's."" The stream included sounds specific to English or Spanish, and sounds shared by the two languages.

The researchers compared monolingual and bilingual babies' brain responses to the language sounds. The most obvious difference they saw was in two brain regions associated with executive function, the prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex. In these regions, the Spanish-English bilingual babies had stronger brain responses to speech sounds, compared with English-only babies.

The findings align with brain studies in bilingual and monolingual adults, Ferjan Ramírez said. The boost bilingualism gives to executive function areas in the brain could arise from bilinguals needing to switch back and forth between languages, allowing them to routinely practice and improve executive function skills.

Other brain evidence from the study should be a relief for parents wondering if their bilingual baby is learning enough language:

""The 11-month-old baby brain is learning whatever language or languages are present in the environment and is equally capable of learning two languages as it is of learning one language,"" Ferjan Ramírez said.

""Our results underscore the notion that not only are very young children capable of learning multiple languages, but that early childhood is the optimum time for them to begin,"" she said.

Adults who were born prematurely or at a below average weight are more likely to have weaker bones and an increased risk of fracture and osteoporosis later in life. This research, presented at the European Congress of Endocrinology, could lead to recommendations that high-risk individuals follow diets rich in calcium, vitamin D and protein, and undertake weight-bearing exercise. 
 
Worldwide, approximately 10% of babies are born preterm and are subject to multiple health risks later in life. The human body concentrates calcium for bone development during the third trimester of pregnancy; if this is interrupted due to premature birth, babies may risk suffering poor bone health later in life. 
  
This study by researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology examined the bone mass of 186 adults, of both genders.  Peak bone mass is achieved between 20 and 30 years of age and is a good indicator of fracture risk; the sample was therefore made up of adults of 26-28 years of age. Of these 186 individuals, 52 were born prematurely with very low birth weight (1265g) and 59 were born at term but with low birth weight (2950g). The further 75 - who were born at term with average birth weight (3700g) - formed a control group. 
  
The researchers found that both low birth weight groups had a lower peak bone mass than controls. However, once height - a factor which greatly influences bone mass - was adjusted for, this lower bone mass was accounted for in the group born at term; the research showed that low bone mass in this group was partly due to smaller body size. This was not the case in the preterm, very low birth weight group where body size alone could not account for the low bone mass, highlighting this group as particularly high risk. Differences in physical activity and calcium intake were also adjusted for, and differences in bone mass between groups still persisted. Smoking habits did not differ between the groups, and the occurrence of previous fractures was also similar.
  
Dr Chandima Balasuriya, who led the study, states that follow-up of these children is important. ""Ensuring children with low birth weight have a diet rich in calcium, vitamin D and protein, in combination with exercise regimes involving weight-bearing physical activities, will help reduce risk of bone fractures later in life.""
  
The next stage for the research will be to look at what causes babies to be born with low birth weights. ""We want to examine the ultrasounds to determine whether low birth weight babies are genetically programmed to be smaller, or if it might be a result of growth restriction. We are also analysing mothers' blood to see how vitamin A and D status might relate to their children's bone health,"" said Dr Balasuriya.

214,272091,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/314196.php,"Whole-fat milk consumption associated with leaner children, research finds",Pediatrics / Children's Health,Pediatrics / Children's Health,Nutrition / Diet,,,2,5,3,4,5,3,3,3,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,,,,,"
Children who drink whole milk are leaner and have higher vitamin D levels than those who drink low-fat or skim milk, new research suggests.

Children who drank whole (3.25 per cent fat content) milk had a Body Mass Index score that was 0.72 units lower than those who drank 1 or 2 per cent milk in the study published today in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

That's comparable to the difference between having a healthy weight and being overweight, said lead author Dr. Jonathon Maguire, a pediatrician at St. Michael's Hospital.

The study did not assess why consuming higher fat content milk was associated with lower BMI scores. But Dr. Maguire hypothesized that children who drank whole milk felt fuller than those who drank the same amount of low-fat or skim milk. If children don't feel full from drinking milk, they are more likely to eat other foods that are less healthy or higher in calories, said Dr. Maguire. Therefore children who drink lower fat milk may actually consume more calories overall than those who drink whole milk.

The study also found that children who drank one cup of whole milk each day had comparable vitamin D levels to those who drank nearly 3 cups of one per cent milk. This could be because vitamin D is fat soluble, meaning it dissolves in fat rather than water. Milk with higher fat content therefore contains more vitamin D. There may also be an inverse relationship in children between body fat and vitamin D stores, according to the study; as children's body fat increases, their vitamin D stores decrease.

""Children who drink lower fat milk don't have less body fat, and they also don't benefit from the higher vitamin D levels in whole milk,"" said Dr. Maguire. ""It's a double negative with low fat milk.""

The study's findings differ from Health Canada, National Institutes of Health and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines recommending two servings of low fat (one per cent or two per cent) milk for children over the age of two to reduce the risk of childhood obesity.

Dr. Maguire said the findings indicated a need to closely examine existing nutritional guidelines around milk fat consumption to make sure they are having the desired effect. Childhood obesity has tripled in the past 30 years while consumption of whole milk has halved over the same period.

""What kind of milk our children should be consuming is something we need to seek the right answer for,"" said Dr. Maguire.

For this study, researchers studied 2,745 children ages two to six years attending well-child visits. They surveyed parents, measured height and weight to calculate BMI and took blood samples to assess vitamin D levels. All were enrolled in the Applied Research Group for Kids (TARGet Kids!), collaboration between children's doctors and researchers from St. Michael's Hospital and The Hospital for Sick Children. The program follows children from birth with the aim of preventing common problems in the early years and understanding their impact on health and disease later in life.

Of those studied, 49 per cent drank whole milk, 35 per cent drank two per cent milk, 12 per cent drank one per cent milk and four per cent drank skim milk. Less than one per cent of children drank some combination of the four types of milk.

215,256893,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/298596.php,Genetic study finds association between reduced vitamin D and multiple sclerosis risk,Multiple Sclerosis,Multiple Sclerosis,Nutrition / Diet,,,3,3,2,2,4,3,1,3,1,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,,,,,"Genetic findings support observational evidence that lower vitamin D levels are associated with increased risk of multiple sclerosis, according to a new research article by Brent Richards, from McGill University, Canada, and colleagues published this week in PLOS Medicine.

Multiple sclerosis is a debilitating autoimmune disease that affects the nerves in the brain and spinal cord. There is no known cure for multiple sclerosis and it usually presents between the ages of 20 and 40 years. While some observational evidence suggests there may be a link between lower vitamin D levels and multiple sclerosis risk, it is difficult to infer a causal relationship because individuals who develop multiple sclerosis in these studies might share another unknown characteristic that increases their risk of multiple sclerosis (this is known as confounding).

Using a genetic technique called Mendelian randomization to reduce the possibility of confounding the authors examined whether there was an association between genetically reduced vitamin D levels (measured by the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the clinical determinant of vitamin D status) and susceptibility to multiple sclerosis among participants in the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium study, which involves 14,498 people with multiple sclerosis and 24,091 healthy controls. The authors found that a genetic decrease in the natural-log-transformed vitamin D level by one standard deviation was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of multiple sclerosis.

While the Mendelian randomization approach used by the authors largely avoids the possibility of confounding or reverse causation, the reliability of these findings may be limited by some of the assumptions made by the researchers during their analysis.

Nevertheless the authors conclude, ""genetically lowered vitamin D levels are strongly associated with increased susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. Whether vitamin D sufficiency can delay, or prevent, multiple sclerosis onset merits further investigation in long-term randomized controlled trials.""

The authors also note, ""ongoing randomized controlled trials are currently assessing vitamin D supplementation for the treatment and prevention of multiple sclerosis ... and may therefore provide needed insights into the role of vitamin D supplementation.""

216,273375,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315491.php,"Diabetes accounts for more US deaths than previously thought, study shows",Diabetes,Diabetes,Public Health,,,1,4,3,2,5,3,2,4,3,2.0,4.0,3.0,,,,,,,"
Diabetes accounts for 12 percent of deaths in the United States, a significantly higher percentage than previous research revealed, making it the third-leading cause of death after heart disease and cancer, according to findings from the University of Pennsylvania and Boston University published in PLOS ONE.

""Another way of saying that is, if diabetes were eliminated as a disease process, the number of deaths would decline by 12 percent,"" said Samuel Preston, a sociology professor in Penn's School of Arts & Sciences and part of the Population Studies Center. ""There has been only one similar, earlier research effort, and it was based on data from the 1980s and early '90s. It showed deaths attributable to diabetes amounted to roughly 4 percent of total deaths.""

Andrew Stokes, a demographer at Boston University who earned a master's degree and a Ph.D. from Penn, and Preston had published a series of articles about excess mortality associated with obesity, focusing recently on diabetes, one of its main consequences. They turned to two well-known, nationally representative datasets, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES, and the National Health Interview Survey, or NHIS.

""These are the two major health surveys in the United States,"" Stokes said. ""We can follow people into death records and compare those who have diabetes to those without diabetes.""

For the researchers' study purposes, each had its distinct advantages. NHIS was large, providing a sample size of more than 282,000 people, a subset of which self-reported they had diabetes. Though generating smaller numbers, around 21,800, NHANES offered something NHIS did not: a hemoglobin A1c measure, an objective biomarker indicating whether a person met diabetes criteria without needing that person's account of having such a diagnosis. It also captured those who didn't know they had the disease.

The data showed that people with diabetes have about 90 percent higher death rates than people without diabetes. The researchers also found that diabetes as the ""underlying cause of death"" had been grossly underreported, giving the disease itself less weight as a major contributor to mortality patterns in the U.S.

""When we monitor trends in the health of populations,"" Stokes said, ""and we look at the mortality statistics, some major threats to U.S. mortality and life expectancy stand out, like drug and alcohol poisonings and suicide. Diabetes didn't.""

Annually, the U.S. government releases mortality estimates per disease, including diabetes. But, because someone with diabetes often has other health-care complications - cardiovascular disease, kidney disease - it can be challenging to pinpoint exact cause of death, leading to ambiguity on a death certificate and to inaccurate mortality statistics.

""There is only one underlying cause of death on a death certificate,"" Preston said. But ""diabetes is not listed as frequently as it is involved in the death of individuals.""

More accurate assessment of this epidemic is crucial now, given the sharp increases in its prevalence. In 1980, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 5.53 million people in the United States with diabetes; in 2014, the most recent year for which statistics exist, that number jumped to 21.95 million people, a nearly 300 percent increase.

""American life expectancy has been growing at a very slow rate for the past decade or so, even decreasing slightly in 2015,"" Preston said. ""It hasn't yet been established statistically, but it's fairly likely that obesity and diabetes together are an important factor in this slowdown. We believe that these estimates will prove useful in helping to more precisely identify their roles.""

For now, Stokes and Preston stress the necessity for large-scale solutions in general.

""What our results point to,"" Stokes said, ""is the need for strategies at the population level to combat the epidemics of obesity and diabetes. We need something on a population scale because it's a major issue. It's not an issue that's confined to certain subsets of the population.""

Experts at Johns Hopkins have linked scientific evidence spanning more than 30 years to suggest an explanation for why  testicular cancer  patients like seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong survive far better than patients with other advanced  cancers . Their commentary in the July 26 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association reveals how a simple factor - heat sensitivity - may make testicular cancer cells more susceptible to standard treatments and die off more readily. Heat also may offer a strategy against other malignancies as well, they said.
   
""If we understand how heat may naturally help kill testicular cancer cells, then perhaps we can make it happen in other solid tumors,"" said Robert Getzenberg, Ph.D., professor and director of urology research at Johns Hopkins. ""More than 80 percent of men with widespread testicular cancer can achieve a cure. In other cancers, the cure rate is far less.""
   
Armstrong's  tumor , like those of all primary testicular cancer, began in the testes, which are a few degrees cooler than the rest of the body to keep heat-sensitive sperm safe. When his cancer cells spread into warmer regions of the body, the Hopkins scientists believe the temperature boost may have weakened protein scaffolding within the cancer cell's nucleus, making the nuclear DNA more vulnerable to  chemotherapy  and radiation.
   
""Heat is at the center of many cellular changes,"" according to Donald Coffey, Ph.D., who is the Catherine Iola & J. Smith Michael Distinguished Professor of Urology, Oncology, Pathology, and Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences at Johns Hopkins. ""It drives everything from reproduction to fighting infection, and now we'd like to harness its power to fight cancer."" Scientists in the past have observed that  fevers  accompanying infections sometimes improved the outcome for some cancer patients, but until now, Coffey said, ""scientists haven't connected precisely how heat affects the scaffolding and might be one of the reasons treatment can cure tumors such as Lance Armstrong's.""
   
Support for the theory came from an unrelated study by researchers at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School of men with undescended testes, a fairly common birth defect in which the genitals remain stuck in the pelvis after birth instead of descending into the scrotum. Without treatment,  infertility  is common and further examination of the men's sperm showed that the sperm cells' nuclear protein scaffolding, known technically as the nuclear matrix, was also wrecked. The nuclear matrix, found in the nucleus of all cells, was first discovered in the early 1980s by a team of Hopkins scientists led by Coffey, and shown to be heat-sensitive by researchers at the Washington University in St. Louis.
   
""The warmer region of the pelvis made the nuclear matrix in the cells that make sperm unstable and prone to death,"" says Theodore DeWeese, M.D., professor and director of the Department of Radiation Oncology and Molecular Radiation Sciences, ""and cancer cells already have unstable nuclear matrices."" He and his colleagues say it is logical to think that ""if we give a cancer cell more heat to completely disrupt its matrix, and then add toxic drugs and radiation, the cancer cell may be so disabled that it won't be able to replicate and will die.""
   
Heat therapy is already used in a handful of cancer centers around the country, and has been applied for thousands of years as an ancient cure-all for ailments ranging from  back pain  to  arthritis . Although people flock to hot baths and springs to immerse their entire body, the Hopkins trio believes that selectively heating cancer cells may not only be more effective, but also prevent matrix damage in normal tissues.
   
""Once we've devised the best way to deliver heat to cancer cells, we will test the technique in animal models to help define the right temperature and doses of chemo and  radiation therapy ,"" says DeWeese.
   
To direct heat only to cancer cells, the researchers are investigating the use of nanoparticles that have an affinity for surface proteins carried by cancer cells. Once the nanoparticle finds the correct ""address"" of the cancer cell, it slips through the cell's surface and heats the cell from the inside out after exposure to a magnetic field.
   
The Hopkins scientists believe that, if injected through the bloodstream, magnetic nanoparticles may be able to reach tumors throughout most of the body. And as long as the nanoparticles penetrate most of the cells in the tumor, the temperature increase will spread to the entire mass.
   
On a parallel track, the Hopkins group is looking at other temperature targets for heat's cancer-fighting properties that may work in tandem with the nuclear matrix. For example, they are looking at blocking proteins whose primary role is to act as fire blankets to coat the nuclear matrix and preserve it from heat damage. These so-called ""heat shock proteins"" also have a second role as ""chaperones"" to other proteins, ensuring their proper interaction and shape, and, depending on these interactions, may play a role in cancer-cell death.
   
Preliminary research is under way at Johns Hopkins to refine heat-delivery-systems and test them in  prostate cancer  animal models.

A new study has found that high levels of consumption of red and processed meat are associated with an increased risk of 

 colorectal cancer , whereas high levels of fish consumption are associated with a decreased risk of the disease.    
Elio Riboli, M.D., M.P.H., and Teresa Norat M.S., M.P.H., of the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France, 

and colleagues used data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), a cohort of more than 

half a million Western Europeans, to examine the associations between intakes of red and processed meat, poultry, and fish 

and colorectal cancer risk.    
During a mean follow-up of 4.8 years, 1,329 cases of colorectal cancer were documented. Among the study population, the risk 

of developing colorectal cancer over 10 years was 1.71% for subjects in the highest category of red and processed meat 

consumption compared with 1.28% for subjects in the lowest category. The risk of developing colorectal cancer was 1.86% among 

subjects in the lowest category of fish consumption compared with 1.28% among subjects in the highest category. There was no 

association between poultry consumption and colorectal cancer risk.

A medication used to treat other types
of  cancer  strangles drug-resistant, metastatic  prostate cancer  by cutting
off its blood supply, researchers from The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center report in the June 7 issue of the Journal of the
National Cancer Institute.    

    Imatinib, known commercially as Gleevec, worked best when combined with
the  chemotherapy  paclitaxel to slash the incidence of bone metastases and
the size of tumors in mice injected with a multiple-drug resistant form of
prostate cancer. Tumors were found in only 4 of 18 mice treated with the
combination, median  tumor  weight was one tenth of a gram, and the cancer
spread to the lymph nodes in three cases. Tumors grew in all 19 control
mice, their median tumor weight was 1.3 grams, and all metastasized to the
lymph nodes.    

    This extremely drug-resistant form of the cancer, designed by the
research team to emulate the grim clinical reality of prostate cancer that
has spread into the bone, successfully warded off the combined medications
in lab experiments, said Isaiah J. Fidler, D.V.M., Ph.D., chair of the
Department of Cancer Biology and director of the Cancer Metastasis Research
Center at M. D. Anderson.    

    \""Why, then, did it work so well in the animal? Because we didn\'t attack
the tumor, we attacked the blood vessels. We target and destroy the
vasculature that provides oxygen and nutrients to tumor cells,\"" said
Fidler, the paper\'s senior author.    

    Fidler and colleagues show in the JNCI paper that imatinib killed
tumor- related blood vessel (endothelial) cells by inactivating the
platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGF-R) on the cell surface. This
prevents the receptor\'s activation either by PDGF binding to it externally
or by a signal generated internally by the cell.    

    Activation of PDGF-R stimulates the birth of new blood vessels,
promotes cell division and migration, and inhibits a protective form of
cell suicide known as apoptosis, all harmful effects in the service of a
cancer cell.    

    With imatinib preventing activation of PDGF-R, Fidler said, the
endothelial cells died by apoptosis first, with tumor cells following suit
one to two weeks later.    

    Fidler said the findings are a vibrant example of the \""seed and soil\""
hypothesis in metastasis -- the deadly spreading of a cancer from its organ
of origin to other organs, a process that kills 90 percent of all patients
who die from their disease.    

    In landmark findings, Fidler and colleagues demonstrated that the vast
majority of cancer cells that depart a tumor die swiftly once in
circulation and that metastases originate from less than 1 percent of a
cancer\'s cells and even can arise from a single cell.    







    When these metastatic \""seeds\"" enter circulation, they still need to
find the exact microenvironment that permits them to grow. For prostate
cancer, the second-leading cause of cancer death among men, that
microenvironment is the bone.    

    Earlier research by Fidler and colleagues showed PDGF-R activation in
metastatic prostate tumors adjacent to the bone but not in tumor cells next
to muscle. PDGF-R also was activated in tumor-associated endothelial cells
in the bone, but not in those blood vessel cells in neighboring muscle.    

    A JNCI paper by Fidler and colleagues in 2003 showed that blocking
PDGF-R signaling in the mouse model of metastatic prostate cancer cut the
incidence of cancer, reduced the size of tumors and incidence of
metastasis.    

    The question was whether the combination of imatinib and paclitaxel
achieved this by attacking the tumor itself or the tumor-related blood
vessels. This week\'s JNCI paper answers that question: it kills the blood
vessels first. \""Here, we attack the soil. The seeds can be resistant. Kill
the endothelial cell, you kill the soil,\"" Fidler said.    

    Imatinib had an effect by itself, but the best result came from the
pairing with paclitaxel, known commercially as Taxol, which induces
apoptosis in non-resistant cancer cells. Taxol, developed by the
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., is frontline therapy for prostate cancer but
eventually loses its effect as resistant tumor cells proliferate.    

    Gleevec, developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, is used to
treat chronic myelogenous  leukemia  and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
    Cancer cells are biologically diverse and genetically unstable, Fidler
says, so it is highly unlikely that a single therapy will prevail,
necessitating a multi-modal attack on the disease.    

    Paul Mathew, M.D., assistant professor, and Christopher Logothetis,
M.D., professor and chair of the Department of Genitourinary Medical
Oncology at M. D. Anderson, are leading a phase II clinical trial employing
imatinib and docetaxel against androgen-independent prostate cancer.
Docetaxel is in the same family of medication as paclitaxel.    

    This research project was funded by a Cancer Center Support Core grant
and a Specialized Programs in Research Excellence (SPORE) grant, both from
the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health. Fidler,
Mathew and Logothetis have research projects that are sponsored by Novartis
Pharmaceuticals.

The study - led by Margaret R. Karagas, PhD, from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire - is published in JAMA Pediatrics.

According to the study authors, the recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) for inorganic arsenic concentrations in polished white rice is 200 nanograms per gram (ng/g), and the proposed US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) limit for infant rice cereal is 100 ng/g.

However, the researchers say many infant rice cereals may contain inorganic arsenic concentrations that exceed these limits.

Until now, rice consumption in early childhood in the US has not been well defined, and previous research has suggested that arsenic exposure in utero and in early life could be linked with adverse effects on fetal growth, as well as infant and child immunity and neurodevelopment.

The researchers note that arsenic found in rice and rice products can be in either an inorganic or organic form; nearly all arsenic in drinking water is inorganic.

They say that, although the toxic effects of inorganic arsenic have been established, laboratory evidence has suggested that organic forms could also present a health risk. They add, however, that ""further data are needed.""

To further investigate, Karagas and colleagues looked at how often infants ate rice products during their first year of life and examined the link with urinary arsenic concentrations.

In total, there were 759 infants born between 2011-2014 who were included in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. The researchers conducted phone interviews with the infants' parents every 4 months until 12 months of age.

When the infants were 1 year old, the team assessed dietary patterns during the past week, which included information on whether the infant had eaten rice cereal, white or brown rice, or foods made with rice or sweetened with brown rice syrup.

Staring in 2013, the researchers collected infant urine samples, along with a 3-day food diary. For 129 infants, more detailed data was available, including information on diet and total urinary arsenic at 12 months of age. Additionally, for 48 infants, the researchers had data on urinary arsenic species.

The team found that of the 759 infants, 80% had rice cereal in their first year of life, and 64% started between 4-6 months of age. Additionally, at 12 months of age, 43% of the babies ate some type of rice product in the past week. Of these, 13% ate white rice and 10% ate brown rice, with an average of one to two servings each week.

Of the total infants, 24% ate food made with rice or sweetened rice syrup in the past week. According to the food diaries, 55% of the infants consumed some type of rice product in the 2 days before the urine sample collection.

Results from the urine samples at 12 months of age showed that arsenic levels were higher in infants who ate rice or foods mixed with rice, compared with those who ate no rice.

Furthermore, among the infants who ate brown or white rice, their total urinary arsenic concentrations were twice as high as those who ate no rice.

The researchers say their results suggest consuming rice increases infants' arsenic exposure, and they suggest introducing regulations to reduce exposure ""during this critical phase of development.""

They add:

""In addition to being more highly exposed to As [arsenic], children appear to be far more sensitive to the potential carcinogenic effects of As, and have a heightened risk for adverse growth, adverse immune response and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, even at relatively low levels of exposure.""

Although their study benefits from a large sample size, the researchers say that because their study group is from northern New England and used private, unregulated water systems, it may affect the generalizability of their results.

Additionally, other dietary sources of arsenic could contribute to urinary arsenic concentrations - such as apple juice - which were not accounted for in the study.

Still, the results certainly give parents and regulators some food for thought.

In other food news, Medical News Today recently reported that consuming alcohol and processed meat may be linked to stomach cancer.

White patients cope better with the pressure of  cancer  than their British Asian counterparts according to research 

published on-line today (Thursday) in the British Journal of Cancer*.   
Researchers carried out the study in Leicester, and looked at coping styles among 200 white and British Asian cancer 

patients. They found \'denial\' was top of the strategies used by British Asians.    
Conversely, more white patients coped with their illness by not dwelling on their cancer compared with British Asian 

patients. This attitude has been linked to less  anxiety  and  depression .    
About half of British Asians surveyed said they did not really believe that they had cancer, despite being told and agreeing 

to cancer treatment compared with less than a third of white patients. In both groups denial was linked to an increase in 

depression.    
The study based in Leicester applied a rating system used in hospitals to find out how depressed or anxious patients were by 

looking at their answers to a standard questionnaire.    
The combination of answers threw new light on how an ethnically diverse Britain copes with cancer diagnosis.    
British Asian patients felt more helpless and were also likelier to be depressed and to feel that fate controlled events. 

   
Dr Paul Symonds, one of the researchers at the University of Leicester, says: \""Leicester has a large ethnic minority 

population. In order to provide optimal support for all patients we need to know how different ethnic groups cope with a 

diagnosis of cancer. Asian patients seem to suffer greater psychological distress following a diagnosis of cancer. We intend 

to conduct further studies in a larger group of patients to study whether Asians and white patients understand cancer in 

different ways.\""    
Kate Law, Head of Clinical Trials at Cancer Research UK, owners of the British Journal of Cancer, says: \""This is an 

interesting study which includes the British Asian community when looking at coping styles used to deal with cancer. In this 

study, the British Asian patients appear to have an unhealthy attitude to a cancer diagnosis, often leading to depression, 

whereas white patients seem to deal with it better and have a better outlook.    
\""This could be down to many factors, but if misunderstanding of cancer is one, then the NHS may need to focus on a targeted 

education campaign once this work has been further substantiated.\""

Extreme heat and heavy rainfall are related to increased risk of hospitalization for asthma in Maryland, according to a study by University of Maryland School of Public Health researchers.

Based on over a decade of asthma hospitalization data (115,923 cases from 2000-2012), researchers observed higher risk of asthma hospitalization after extreme heat or extreme precipitation events. The increases in risk were particularly high during summer months. Their findings are published in the journal Environmental Health.

""Previous scientific studies have shown that extreme weather events are becoming more common, more intense, and longer lasting in response to our changing climate. Our study shows is that increases in the number of extreme heat and extreme precipitation events, particularly during summer months, lead to more asthma hospitalizations in Maryland."" said Dr. Amir Sapkota, senior author of the study and an associate professor at the Maryland Institute for Applied Environmental Health.

Recent estimates suggest that over 430,000 adults and 125,000 children in Maryland are living with asthma. Researchers observed a 23% increase in risk of asthma hospitalizations when there was an extreme heat event during summer months. This risk was higher among 5-17 year olds. Similarly, extreme precipitation events during summer months increased the risk of asthma hospitalizations by 11%. ""Our data show that the risk of hospitalization for asthma related to extreme weather varies across demographic subgroups in Maryland. We need to take such differences into account when designing public health responses to climate change"", said Dr. Sutyajeet Soneja, a postdoctoral fellow at the Maryland Institute for Applied Environmental Health, and lead author of the study.

To identify extreme weather events, the researchers relied on county and calendar day specific thresholds for precipitation and maximum temperature (90th and 95th percentile, respectively) that were calculated based on 30 years of baseline data (1960-1989). The researchers suggest that extreme heat events during summer months may lead to higher concentration of harmful air pollutants such as ozone, which is known to exacerbate asthma. Extreme precipitation events may lead to release of pollen spores, leading to severe asthma attack and subsequent hospitalization.

A study conducted at the UPV/EHU-University of the Basque Country has concluded that neophobic children have a lower quality index in terms of the Mediterranean diet

Food neophobia is the fear of or refusal to try new foods. This is a typical feature in infant development. Nevertheless, it may end up becoming a habit even in adulthood. A study conducted at the UPV/EHU among children between 8 and 16 has concluded that the neophobic participants have a lower quality index in terms of the Mediterranean diet and, what is more, they have greater anxiety and lower self-esteem.
 
The behaviour involving rejection of new foodstuffs is a typical phase in infant development, above all in 2- to 3-year-olds and which subsides around the age of 5. The children who go through dietary neophobia also display signs of anguish and anxiety and this behaviour may even turn into a habit in adulthood.

In her PhD thesis the researcher of the UPV/EHU's Faculty of Psychology Edurne Maiz conducted a study on 831 schoolchildren between the ages of 8 and 16. In the study she used questionnaires on infant neophobia -adapted for the thesis- in which the participants were asked about whether they were prepared to eat new foodstuffs. Various data were also gathered on the body composition of the participants as well as on their lifestyle (for example, diet and physical exercise), parental dietary styles and different variables (self-esteem and anxiety). From all this, explained the researcher, ""we have found statistically significant differences in many variables"".
 
Neophobic behaviour may have negative dietary implications insofar as it reduces the variety of food eaten. The neophobic participants displayed a lower quality index in terms of the Mediterranean diet, and this is mainly due to the reduced consumption of fruit and vegetables and an increase in foods regarded as being for occasional consumption.

On the whole, parents tend to control what, how much and when their children eat. Very often parents try to get their children to eat new foodstuffs; the pressure parents exert caused by the frustration they feel when the food is rejected may negatively affect the child's emotional state, and what is more, is associated with greater levels of neophobia. In the research, the neophobic children reported that their parents use the parental feeding style known as stimulation and less control than the parents of neophilic children (children who eat everything and who like to try new foodstuffs). ""We have deduced,"" explained Edurne Maiz, ""that parents basically control and stimulate a lot, but a moment comes when they give up because parental suffering is also present in all this.""

As regards anxiety, the data lead one to understand that both in childhood and adolescence, the neophobes are more anxious than the neophiliacs. Likewise, with respect to self-esteem, neophobes scored in childhood less than the neophiliacs in the five dimensions studied within self-concept (family, social, physical, emotional and academic); and, in adolescence their scores in family and physical self-concept were lower.

In any case, no significant difference was found between them regarding body composition. ""This could be due to the fact that there are nutritional supplements which at a given moment can be taken as a food supplement,"" said the researcher.

The researcher is keen ""to send out a message to parents to be patient so that the cases of infant food neophobia do not develop or get worse,"" since ""it has been seen that there are a considerable number of adults and children who have serious problems because of this,"" she explained. The researcher says that to avoid this problem it is important for there to be a strong parental bond with the child, and she also recommends ""having a relaxed, pleasant atmosphere at mealtimes, that the children should participate in preparing the food and doing the shopping, using positive reinforcements and, finally, being a good model"".",0

Despite a high rate of  depression , few  stroke  survivors take  antidepressants , according to a study in  Stroke: Journal of the American Heart Association .
   
Studies have suggested an association between stroke survival and mood disturbances such as depression. But it\'s been unclear how many stroke survivors suffer from depression and how many are treated, particularly in the long term, said Seana L. Paul, B.Sc. (Hons), lead author of the study and researcher at the National Stroke Research Institute in Victoria, Australia.
   
\""Stroke patients suffering from depression have been found to have reduced quality of life and a higher rate of death, so it is important to identify and treat depression after stroke,\"" Paul said.
   
From May 1, 1997 to April 30, 1999, researchers identified those who had a stroke among 306,631 people in the North East Melbourne Stroke Incidence Study (NEMESIS). Researchers excluded those who had suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain).
   
Nurse researchers visited the 289 participants (51 percent men, average age 73) in their homes five years after their stroke. During the interviews, the researchers assessed participants for depression and asked about all medications they were taking, including antidepressants.
   
At five years after stroke, researchers found:
   
    * Nearly one in five stroke survivors (17 percent) were suffering from depression.   
    * Only 22 percent of those with depression were taking an antidepressant.   
    * About 28 percent of those taking antidepressants were still depressed.   
    * 72 percent of those taking antidepressants were not depressed, which could mean the medication was successful in this group. 
   
\""We have confirmed that depression is common even up to five years after stroke, and that the majority of those taking antidepressant medication were not depressed,\"" Paul said. \""This provides indirect evidence that antidepressants are effective in treating depression in stroke patients.\""
   
She said several factors contribute to the small percentage of depressed stroke patients taking antidepressant medication.
   
\""The low treatment levels found in this study may indicate that physicians are unwilling to prescribe treatments that have not been demonstrated to be an effective and safe treatment for depression among stroke patients,\"" Paul said. \""Another factor may be that depression among stroke patients is not being diagnosed.
   
\""We know that stroke survivors who are not depressed live longer, higher-quality lives than those who are depressed. Consequently, educating physicians, stroke survivors and their families about the risk of depression after stroke may increase identification of depression and lead to improved treatment.\""
   
The findings demonstrate the urgent need for a large randomized controlled trial of antidepressant medication after stroke, she said.
   
In previous studies, researchers have only used small samples of patients and have had inadequate follow up and limited ability to properly assess the efficacy of antidepressant medication in depression after stroke.

The new findings on bi-dialectalism are published in the journal Cognition, following a study undertaken by researchers from the University of Cambridge, the University of Cyprus, and the Cyprus University of Technology.
  
Although a topic of continuing academic and public scrutiny, a lot of research to date reports a positive cognitive net effect for multilingual children compared to children who speak only one language.
  
The effect is usually manifest in attention, cognitive flexibility and the ability to inhibit irrelevant information, with some researchers arguing that the advantages of bilingualism are evident throughout the human lifespan. Until now, however, there has been very little research on children speaking two dialects which may only be separated by subtle linguistic differences.
  
Bi-dialectalism, the systematic use of two different dialects of the same language, is widespread in many parts of the world. In the USA millions of children grow up speaking African American English at home as well as Mainstream American English at school.
  
Similar situations arise in many parts of Europe, such as the German-speaking parts of Switzerland, where school-children may only feel comfortable to talk about school subjects in High German, but switch to Swiss-German for everyday conversation.
  
British English, Gaelic and Welsh have well established dialects as well as newly emerging ones such as Multicultural London English, which has a rising number of speakers, especially among young, urban people.
  
To date, bi-dialectalism can be found in Lowland Scotland (in speakers of Scots and Standard Scottish English), in parts of Northern Ireland and elsewhere. However, the criteria for classifying two varieties as dialects rather than independent languages are not strictly objective and it could be debated whether these are cases of bilingualism instead.
  
Dr Kyriakos Antoniou and Dr Napoleon Katsos from the University of Cambridge studied the cognitive performance of children who grew up speaking both Cypriot Greek and Standard Modern Greek - two varieties of Greek which are closely related but differ from each other on all levels of language analysis (vocabulary, pronunciation and grammar).
  
The study showed that multilingual and bi-dialectal children exhibited an advantage over monolingual children that was evident in composite cognitive processes including memory, attention and cognitive flexibility; suggesting that advantages previously reported for multilingual children could be shared by children speaking any two or more dialects.
  
Dr Kyriakos Antoniou, from Cambridge's Department of Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, said: ""What is exciting and encouraging about our findings is that we were able to replicate the advantages of bilingualism in children who speak two varieties of the same language. They need not be as diverse as English and Mandarin Chinese.
  
""The distance between languages and dialects does not make much of a difference according to our tests and findings. Systematically switching between any two forms of language, even quite similar ones, seems to provide the mind with the extra stimulation that leads to higher cognitive performance.
  
""Our findings could be significant for parents and children in the UK and countries across Europe and beyond where children speak a variety of different dialects. Germany, Italy and Spain all have significant numbers of dialectal speakers, as do parts of the US and China. With the rise and increased recognition of dialects in the UK, bi-dialectalism might become even more relevant in the UK in the near future.
  
""What our research suggests, contrary to some widely held beliefs, is that we don't have to treat multilingual or bi-dialectal children as problematic. When it comes to language, plurality is an advantage.""
  
The study consisted of 64 bi-dialectal children, 47 multilingual children and 25 monolingual children. Comparisons between the three groups were performed in two stages and the socio-economic status, language proficiency, and general intelligence of all children taking part was factored into the research methodology.
  
Dr Napoleon Katsos, one of the study authors, said: ""Previous research has documented positive associations between childhood bilingualism and cognitive abilities.
  
""The novel and most important contribution of this study is that it showed similar positive effects extend to children speaking two closely related dialects of the same language. In qualitative terms, the effects of bi-dialectalism and multilingualism were, in general, quite similar. However, more research is needed on this topic.
  
""Dialects are very much under-recognised and undervalued. This kind of research can make people appreciate there is an advantage to bi-dialectalism and this may be important when we think about our identity, about how we educate children and the importance of language learning.""
  
Dr Antoniou and Dr Katsos are now retesting and extending their hypotheses on a larger scale in Belgium, in collaboration with researchers at the University of Brussels.  Belgium offers an ideal testing ground, with dialects of Dutch such as West-Flemish, being spoken alongside more standard versions of Dutch and French. The new study includes larger samples and new measures, to better understand the effects of bi-dialectalism on cognitive and linguistic development and their relation to bilingualism.

Sweet potatoes are an exceptionally nutritious vegetable. High in carotenoids, sweet potatoes are a great source of vitamin A, which is great for eye health, has antioxidant and anti-aging properties, and has also been linked to cancer prevention. 


Additionally, sweet potatoes are rich in a wide range of B vitamins, including B-1, or thiamine, B-2 and B-3 - riboflavin and niacin, respectively - as well as B-5 and B-6. According to the National Institutes of Health, B vitamins help our body process food into energy, as well as form red blood cells. 


New research - published in the journal Heliyon - suggests the starchy water left over from cooking sweet potatoes may have slimming effects and help digestion. 

A team of researchers - led by Dr. Koji Ishiguro from the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization in Japan - were looking for ways to reuse the wastewater resulting from processing sweet potatoes on an industrial scale. As such, they thought of testing its nutritional value and dietary effects. 


According to the International Potato Center, sweet potatoes are one of the world's most important food crops, with 105 million metric tons of the vegetable being produced every year around the world, and 95 percent of the crops being grown in developing countries. 


Sweet potatoes are very suitable for processing due to their high starch content. Sweet potato is currently used to produce flour, noodles, bread, candy, pectin, liquors, and other starch and starch-based industrial products. 


In Japan, around 15 percent of sweet potato is used to produce starch-derived products, as well as processed foods and distilled spirits. 


The result is a large amount of wastewater that contains organic residue and is usually discarded in rivers and oceans. This could cause serious environmental problems. 


Since the wastewater also contains proteins, Dr. Ishiguro and team decided to investigate its effects on digestion in mice. 

""We throw out huge volumes of wastewater that contains sweet potato proteins - we hypothesized that these could affect body weight, fat tissue, and other factors. Finding alternative uses for the sweet potato proteins in wastewater could be good for the environment and industry, and also potentially for health.""
Dr. Koji Ishiguro
Researchers fed three groups of mice high-fat diets. One of the groups was given the sweet potato peptide protein (SPP) in a high concentration, and another group in a low concentration. 


After 28 days, researchers weighed the mice and took a series of measurements. They examined their liver mass and measured their fatty tissue, fat cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels. Scientists also measured the levels of leptin and adiponectin, which regulate the body's metabolism and play a key role in obesity and metabolic syndrome. 

Mice that were fed higher levels of SPP had significantly lower body weight and liver mass.

These mice also had lower cholesterol levels and triglycerides, as well as higher levels of the metabolic hormones leptin and adiponectin.

The findings suggest that SPP suppresses the appetite and controls lipid metabolism in mice.

Further research is needed to see if the same effects apply to humans, but Dr. Ishiguro says the results are ""very promising.""
""We were surprised that SPP reduced the levels of fat molecules in the mice and that it appears to be involved controlling appetite suppression molecules. These results are very promising, providing new options for using this wastewater instead of discarding it. We hope SPP is used for the functional food material in future.""

Habitual cycling, whether as transportation to work or as a recreational activity, is associated with lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), according to a study published this week in PLOS Medicine. This cohort study, conducted by Martin Rasmussen of the University of Southern Denmark, and colleagues, included 24,623 men and 27,890 women from Denmark, recruited between the ages of 50 and 65, and compared the association between self-reported recreational and commuter cycling habits with T2D incidence measured in the Danish National Diabetes Registry. The authors found that participants who engaged in habitual cycling were less likely to develop T2D, and risk of developing T2D appeared to decrease with longer time spent cycling per week.  Five years after they were initially recruited, participants were contacted for follow-up and their cycling habits were re-assessed. People who took up habitual cycling during this period were at 20% lower risk for T2D than non-cyclists.
 
While the authors adjusted for potential confounding variables such as diet, alcohol and smoking habits, and physical activity outside of cycling, and also analysed for confounding by waist circumference and body-mass index, there is a chance these results may have been affected by unmeasured confounding, or bias due to patients with missing data, or as a result of self-reported cycling behavior. However, the findings that cycling activity, and even initiating cycling in late adulthood, may reduce risk of T2D, supports development of programs to encourage habitual cycling.
  
Dr. Rasmussen says: ""Because cycling can be included in everyday activities, it may be appealing to a large part of the population. This includes people who due to lack of time, would not otherwise have the resources to engage in physical activity.""
  
He also notes: ""We find it especially interesting that those who started cycling had a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, given that the study population were men and women of middle and old age. This emphasizes that even when entering elderly age, it is not too late to take up cycling to lower one's risk of chronic disease.""
  
This research article is accompanied by a Perspective by Jenna Panter and David Ogilvie calling for public health action to support evaluating interventions designed to increase physical activity habits in the population.

Inadequate food intake and malnourishment in sick people is an area of concern for health policy and Public Health and one which impacts upon the social economics of countries with both high and low incomes. ""Ensuring that patients receive adequate nutrition should therefore be part of an holistic treatment plan,"" explains Karin Schindler, nutritional expert at MedUni Vienna's Department of Medicine III. Morbidity and mortality rates are up to 8-times higher in malnourished patients: in some cases this prolongs the time they need to spend in hospital. Schindler: ""On the other hand, we must bear in mind that 50 - 60% of patients do not eat all of a meal that is offered and this reduced food intake is rarely offset by nutritional care.""

The researchers from MedUni Vienna have now investigated the factors (and their pattern) that influence the food intake of patients on a specific day, nutritionDay, and the healthcare structures that are relevant to nutrition in 91,245 hospitalised patients throughout the world and have published the results in the leading magazine The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

The central finding: the factors of ""reduced mobility"", ""unintentional weight loss"" and ""patient has not eaten enough over the previous week"" signify an increased risk of eating less. Women are more frequently affected than men and very young and very old people more so than people aged between 40 and 79 years. These four factors are practically of equal importance everywhere - even in the USA where patients generally come into hospital with a higher Body Mass Index. The pattern is always the same: illness goes hand-in-hand with a reduced appetite. 

Schindler: ""If any one of these factors is identified, alarm bells should ring.""  The eating patterns of these patients should be monitored and they should be supervised and advised, say the MedUni Vienna experts. ""The excuse that patients often give that ""I am ill so I'm not eating,"" or even ""that's good, at least I'm losing weight"" are not acceptable and are bad for their prognosis. These risk groups need special attention.""

This special attention must be incorporated into the holistic treatment plan. Schindler: ""Firstly patients' eating behaviour should be systematically evaluated on admission to hospital. The simple questions are quick to ask and easy to answer. It should be explained to patients why it is important to eat. It might also be worth considering structural adaptations, such as the possibility of offering smaller portions or highly nutritious snacks between meals or special individual meals. In addition to that, it can be helpful to involve relatives in encouraging them to eat.""

An early phase study pairing an experimental targeted therapy with a common anti-inflammatory produced promising results in patients with advanced  lung cancer , researchers at UCLA's Jonsson Cancer Center reported.    
Pairing the targeted therapy Tarceva with the anti-inflammatory drug Celebrex increased response rates in lung cancer patients by about three-fold, said Dr. Karen Reckamp, an assistant professor of hematology/oncology and lead author of the study. The research appears in the June 1 issue of Clinical Cancer Research, the peer-reviewed journal of the American Association of Cancer Research.    
Previous laboratory studies at UCLA showed that a cell signaling pathway known as COX-2 may be linked to resistance to drugs like Tarceva, which block  tumor  cell growth by targeting the protein EGFR, or epidermal growth factor receptor. Researchers theorized that giving Tarceva with Celebrex, a COX-2 inhibitor, would help battle resistance and prove to be an affective combination against lung cancer.    
Typically, about 10 percent of lung cancer patients respond to Tarceva. In Reckamp's study of the combination therapy, about 33 percent of patients responded.    
""Tarceva alone is a great drug and has a lot of clinical benefits, but for a small proportion of patients,"" Reckamp said. ""With this drug combination, we saw an increase in response rates, indicating we are overcoming some resistance. We also may be beginning to understand the mechanisms of that resistance.""    
Volunteers in the Phase I study, patients with advanced lung cancer that had failed to respond to all conventional therapies, took several Celebrex pills and one Tarceva pill each day. After eight weeks, researchers looked at response rates. Patients were able to stay on the study as long as they didn't experience tumor growth. The longest duration of response was 93 weeks, Reckamp said, about three to four times longer than the average duration of response for a patient with advanced lung cancer.    
The study was part of the Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) in lung cancer at UCLA's Jonsson Cancer, a program funded by the National Cancer Institute at top research institutions nationwide to find better and more effective ways to prevent, detect and treat lung cancer.    
""This trial is an important early step in utilizing combination targeted therapies in lung cancer,"" said Dr. Steven Dubinett, director of UCLA's lung cancer SPORE and a professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine. ""Dr. Reckamp's trial is the first to study increasing doses of a COX-2 inhibitor in lung cancer in an attempt to define an optimal biological dose. Larger trials of combination therapies utilizing this dose will now be required.""    
The biology of an individual's tumor determines whether they will respond to Tarceva. Because researchers don't yet fully understand what biologic characteristics determine response, they can't test patients first to determine who should be given the drug. Since 90 percent of patients don't respond to Tarceva, the drug was not an option for them. Reckamp said a portion of those may now be able to take Tarceva combined with Celebrex.    
Because they target what is broken in a  cancer  cell and leave the healthy cells alone, therapies like Tarceva cause fewer side effects than conventional therapies such as  chemotherapy , which targets all fast growing cells and often results in debilitating side effects. Reckamp characterized the side effects seen with the combination therapy as minor.    
The next step is a larger Phase II study to confirm the efficacy of the combination therapy and further probe the mechanisms of Tarceva resistance, Reckamp said. That study is expected to begin at UCLA in the fall.    
Reckamp's study was the first to determine the safest and most effective dose of Celebrex to use in lung cancer. Previously, doses were based on studies done in  colon cancer  patients.    
""I think the results of this early phase study are promising and I anticipate we'll have a better understanding of Tarceva resistance in the near future,"" she said.    
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in both men and women and accounts for about 29 percent of all cancer deaths. This year alone, 174,470 people will be diagnosed with lung cancer in the United States. Of those, 162,460 will die, according to the American Cancer Society.    
Only about 15 percent of people who get lung cancer reach five-year survival. Those with advanced disease usually survive less than a year.    
""It's crucial that we develop better treatments for this disease,"" Reckamp said.

When it comes to talking about suicide, Americans avoid the topic much the same way they skirted discussions about sex 20 years ago. But the president of the American Association of Suicidology says the time is long overdue for people to start talking about the problem and to launch suicide awareness and prevention programs in the nation's schools.
   
James Mazza will challenge the more than 600 people attending the association's 39th annual meeting in Seattle to make suicide ""a community and societal issue because no one escapes it.""
   
Mazza, a University of Washington associate professor of educational psychology who focuses his research on reducing and preventing suicide, said there is a critical need to initiate suicide awareness and prevention program in the nation's schools. Suicide is currently the third leading cause of death among teenagers and young adults ages 15 to 24, behind traffic accidents and homicide.
   
""Right now we don't do anything that has a  mental health  focus in our schools that is standardized across our state or country. We need to focus on our kids when they are first getting the bumps and bruises of life,"" he said. ""There are no wide-scale school programs on suicide awareness and prevention largely because schools don't have the resources to effectively deal with the at-risk youth they identify. And there are no federally funded resources available for mental health assessment. As a result, schools only focus on having students pass the Washington Assessment of Student Learning or other assessment tests and are ignoring their mental health needs. Education should not be equated to only academics.
   
""We have to have resources dedicated to suicide prevention and awareness in the schools.""
   
The problem, however, transcends the schools, Mazza said, noting that it is the second-leading cause of death among adults 65 and older, the age group also has the nation's highest suicide rate. Mazza said members of the organization must work with businesses, colleges and treatment centers, as well as schools, to deal with suicide prevention and awareness across the life span.
   
""There is a major need for assessment for suicide and to intervene with people of all ages who are at risk for suicide.""

A radiologist at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine has developed a new procedure to treat fractured vertebrae caused by spinal tumors, a procedure that may decrease the risk of complications, which are experienced by 5 to 10% of patients with malignant tumors of the spine.
   
Wade Wong, D.O.F.A.C.R, UCSD professor of  radiology , and San Diego clinician Bassem Georgy, M.D., partially removed spinal tumors from 28 patients before repairing the spine with vertebroplasty - a procedure to cement and stabilize damaged vertebrae. He used a technology that utilizes plasma-mediated radiofrequency energy combined with saline solution to gently and precisely remove soft tissue at low temperature - minimizing damage to healthy tissue.
   
""This image-guided procedure guarantees ultimate accuracy,"" said Wong. It enables us to provide pain relief and improved mobility to patients while minimizing risks that have traditionally limited treatment options for  cancer  patients.""
   
Wong will present his study on May 6 at the American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology (ASITN.) He added that some patients in the study who were previously bedridden became much more active after their  fractures  were repaired using this method, increasing their overall quality of life.
   
Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are common complications of spinal tumors. Approximately 10 percent of the estimated one million VCFs that occur each year in the United States are caused by spinal metastases. Unfortunately, spinal tumors present challenges that traditionally have left many cancer patients with very few treatment options. Open surgery is invasive and involves a long recovery. Traditional vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty - two procedures that utilize bone cement to stabilize the fractured vertebrae - are also risky when a  tumor  is present, because the procedures can cause cancerous cells to spread into the blood stream. They also carry a higher risk of bone cement leaking out of the vertebral body into the spinal canal, potentially leading to paralysis.
   
Wong removed the tumor prior to vertebroplasty on 28 patients using the plasma-mediated procedure commonly known as the ""Coblation SpineWand."" Following the partial removal of the tumor, bone cement was injected into the cavity created by the process in order to stabilize the fractured bone fragments. The researchers report that all 28 patients treated in the study experienced decreased pain and improved function.
   
""I never dreamed it would be this successful,"" said Wong, adding that when first approached the ArthroCare Corporation, manufacturers of the Coblation process, they were skeptical. The device was already in use for other medical applications, such as ear, nose and throat surgery, and arthroscopic applications. ""Generally, a cancerous lesion of the spine can eat away at the bone, which can cause a mass in the spinal canal resulting in paralysis or great pain,"" Wong said.
   
The process first removes tumor bulk, then delivers cement to strength the vertebrae, which reduces pain.
   
""It's like creating a cast to a fracture,"" said Wong, ""but in the inside of the body instead of on the outside.""
   
Using the process doesn't preclude other treatments, such as chemo or  radiation therapy . Though the process doesn't cure the cancer, it can add to the quality of life for the patient.
   
""Even in patients with a malignancy, it doesn't mean it's the end of their life. This procedure allows them to resume activities, like walking or even rollerblading, that they enjoyed before,"" said Wong, adding, ""Quality of life is what's key.""

A reversal of official advice on the dangers of the sun was called for yesterday in what could lead to one of the biggest revisions of a health warning in decades.
   
The head of Britain's drive to cut soaring  skin cancer  rates said the advice to restrict sunbathing is 'draconian and unnecessary' and should be lifted.
   
For at least a decade, doctors have warned sunbathers that 'there is no such thing as a healthy tan'. Now, Dr Neil Walker, chairman of the UK Skin Cancer Prevention Working Party, an umbrella group of more than a dozen professional organisations, says the warning is counter-productive.
   
'The phrase 'no such thing as a healthy tan' is one way of getting the message across that sun damage can lead to the development of potentially fatal skin cancers. I think we need to look at this again. I think telling people to avoid the sun entirely is draconian and unnecessary.'
   
Dr Walker, consultant dermatologist at the Churchill Hospital, Oxford (UK), said millions of people went on holiday every year with the aim of getting a tan and telling them to stay out of the sun invited ridicule.
   
'There are a lot of people [on the working party] who have this almost religious conviction about the dangers of the sun. My view has been that we have got to try to look at things practically. But the zealots rule at the moment.'
   
He added: 'There may be an argument that there is no such thing as a safe tan but it is not an argument that works. We have to find a way of putting the message across about what is the most damaging behaviour, which is why I tell my patients not to bake or burn.'
   
About 50,000 people a year in Britain develop skin cancers, most of which involve minor lesions which are easily removed. In 2000, there were 7,000 cases of  melanoma , the most serious form of skin cancer, up 24 per cent in five years.
   
The rise in melanoma, one of the fastest-growing  cancers , is linked with the growing number of Britons holidaying abroad and some evidence suggests that it is sun exposure in childhood that is the main risk.
   
But some experts say the benefits of the sun have been underplayed. Sitting in the sun is enjoyable and relaxing, makes people feel better and stimulates production of  vitamin D , which may protect against a range of diseases.
   
Professor George Davey Smith and colleagues at the University of Bristol (UK) said in a paper in the British Medical Journal in 1999: 'For many people the small absolute increase in risk of melanoma could easily be outweighed by the effect of reduced sunlight on mood.'
   
Sara Hiom, of Cancer Research UK, defended the warning that there is no safe tan. 'The reasoning behind that comment is that a tan is a sign of DNA damage which can lead to skin cancer later in life. Of course having a tiny bit of golden colour is safer than burning in the sun. But we have to come out with these rather strident comments to get the message across. We have to be rather strict.'

Consuming red meat in amounts above what is typically recommended does not affect short-term cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as blood pressure and blood cholesterol, according to a new review of clinical trials from Purdue University.

""During the last 20 years, there have been recommendations to eat less red meat as part of a healthier diet, but our research supports that red meat can be incorporated into a healthier diet,"" said Wayne Campbell, professor of nutrition science. ""Red meat is a nutrient-rich food, not only as a source for protein but also bioavailable iron.""

The recommendations to limit red meat from the diet come mainly from studies that relate peoples' eating habits to whether they have cardiovascular disease. While these studies suggest that red meat consumption is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, they are not designed to show that red meat is causing cardiovascular disease. So Campbell, doctoral student Lauren O'Connor, and postdoctoral researcher Jung Eun Kim, conducted a review and analysis of past clinical trials, which are able to detect cause and effect between eating habits and health risks. They screened hundreds of related research articles, focusing on studies that met specific criteria including the amount of red meat consumed, evaluation of cardiovascular disease risk factors and study design. An analysis of the 24 studies that met the criteria is published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

""We found that consuming more than half a serving per day of red meat, which is equivalent to a 3 ounce serving three times per week, did not worsen blood pressure and blood total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglyceride concentrations, which are commonly screened by health-care providers,"" O'Connor said.

This research includes all types of red meat, mostly unprocessed beef and pork.

Campbell also said more analysis is needed as the evaluation of blood pressure and cholesterol are not the sole determinants for someone to develop cardiovascular disease. For example, the length of time these experiments were done ranged from a few weeks to a few months as opposed to the years or decades that it could take people to develop cardiovascular disease or have a cardiovascular event.

""It is also important to recognize that our findings are specific to selected indicators for cardiovascular disease risk,"" Campbell said. ""Comparable research is needed to assess other health risk factors from clinical trials, including inflammation and blood glucose control.""

One study, a meta-analysis of 59 trials, found little evidence that diet is associated with survival or prognosis. The other study suggests that neither use of garlic nor  vitamin  supplements delays the progression of precancerous gastric lesions to  cancer .
   
Numerous studies have linked dietary modifications and vitamins to cancer prevention and treatment. But researchers are worried that some dietary changes may not be harmless, a concern echoed by a European Union recommendation to tighten sales of supplements.
   
Steven Thomas, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom, and colleagues used database searches to identify 59 trials that investigated the effects of a diverse range of nutritional interventions on patients with a previous diagnosis of cancer or precancerous lesions. Trial results were combined using meta-analysis.
   
The authors suggest that the trials provide little evidence that specific interventions have any effect on disease-free survival, mortality, or recurrence. They say the impact of most nutritional interventions cannot be estimated reliably because of the limited number of trials, many of which are small or of low quality.
   
The authors write, ""The large personal expenditure on supplements and dietary modifications by patients with cancer demonstrates an urgent need to understand their effects on cancer outcomes. This vulnerable group of people need to be better informed as diet is one of the few areas of their lives where they may feel that they have some control.""
   
A second study of Chinese adults showed that garlic and vitamin supplements did not reduce the prevalence of precancerous lesions or  gastric cancer , but treatment to kill Helicobacter pylori may limit the progression of these lesions to cancer and reduce their prevalence.
   
In Linqu County, China, gastic cancer causes 42% of all cancer deaths, and H. pylori bacteria is present in 67% of adults. H. pylori causes gastric cancer.
   
Wei-Cheng You, M.D., of the Beijing Institute for Cancer Research, Mitchell Gail, M.D., Ph.D., of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., and colleagues tested 3,365 Chinese adults ages 35-64 in Linqu County. Beginning in 1995, the subjects were randomly assigned to receive various combinations of three interventions--one-time treatment with  antibiotics  for H. pylori; long-term vitamin E, C, and  selenium  supplements; or long-term garlic supplements--or a  placebo . The researchers reassessed the patients in 1999 and 2003.
   
The authors found that one-time use of the antibiotics amoxicillin and omeprazole to treat H. pylori infection reduced the severity and progression of precancerous gastric lesions. The data also suggested, but did not prove, that antibiotic treatment reduced gastric cancer incidence. Long-term vitamin and garlic supplementation had no effect on the incidence of gastric cancer or progression of precancerous lesions.
   
The authors write, "" H. pylori treatment reduces the prevalence of precancerous gastric lesions and may reduce gastric cancer incidence [...] Long-term vitamin or garlic supplementation had no beneficial effects.""
   
In an accompanying editorial examining both studies, John A. Baron, M.D., of Dartmouth Medical School in Lebanon, N.H., discusses reasons the two studies may have come to negative conclusions and suggests changes that could have been made to the study designs. He writes, ""Together the two articles in this issue of the Journal well illustrate the contemporary status of chemoprevention: hard to summarize, many negative findings, but some nuggets of progress.""

235,256895,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/298598.php,School lunch study: Visual proof kids are tossing mandated fruits and veggies in trash,Nutrition / Diet,Nutrition / Diet,Pediatrics / Children's Health,,,3,2,2,3,2,2,4,3,4,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,,,,,"In perverse effect, USDA mandate decreased consumption, study shows

Less than a month before Congress votes on whether to reauthorize a controversial program mandating healthier school lunches, a new study confirms the suspicions of school officials - many students are putting the fruits and vegetables they're now required to take straight into the trash, consuming fewer than they did before the law took effect.

The new study, published online in Public Health Reports on Aug. 25, is the first to use digital imaging to capture students' lunch trays before and after they exited the lunch line.

It is also one of the first to compare fruit and vegetable consumption before and after the controversial legislation - the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 - was passed.

After passage of the legislation and the USDA mandates it put in place 2012, the study found that students put more fruits and vegetables on their trays, as required, but consumed fewer of them and increased waste by approximately 56 percent.

""The basic question we wanted to explore was: does requiring a child to select a fruit or vegetable actually correspond with consumption,"" says Sarah Amin, Ph.D., a researcher in Nutrition and Food Sciences at the University of Vermont and lead author on the study.

""The answer was clearly no,"" she said. ""It was heartbreaking to see so many students toss fruits like apples into the trash right after exiting the lunch line.""

Digital imaging produces fast, accurate data

Amin and her co-authors documented almost 500 tray observations over 10 visits to two elementary schools in the Northeast before implementation of the USDA guideline and almost twice as many observations afterwards.

Forty to 60 percent percent of the students at the schools qualified for free or reduced lunch, a marker for low socioeconomic status.

The research team used a digital imaging method that they validated three years ago in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics to measure consumption.

The new methodology, which involved visual estimations and calculations based on digital photographs of trays as students reached the cashier and again after they passed the food disposal area, was faster and more accurate than conventional methodologies that simply weighed food waste.

""The beauty of this method is that you have the data to store and code to indicate what was selected, what was consumed, and what was wasted as opposed to weighed plate waste, where everything needs to be done on site,"" said Amin, who hopes to develop an online training tutorial that could be used by schools across the country to measure consumption and waste.

Revisiting past practices part of answer to increasing consumption

In an earlier study published in the Journal of Child Nutrition and Management, Amin and colleagues looked at what types of fruits and vegetables children selected prior to the new guideline.

They found that children preferred processed fruits and vegetables such as the tomato paste on pizza or 100 percent fruit juice rather than whole varieties.

In addition to making sure those options are available, Amin and her colleagues offer these additional strategies in the paper for increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in school lunch programs:

 
Once schools have fully acclimated to the guidelines, Amin thinks consumption will increase, especially for students who entered as kindergarteners under the new guidelines in 2012 and know no other way.

""An important message is that guidelines need to be supplemented with other strategies to enrich fruit and vegetable consumption. We can't give up hope yet.""

Study co-author Joseph McKenna, from Florida State University (FSU), and colleagues publish their findings in the journal PLOS Computational Biology.

Insulin is produced by beta cells in the pancreas. Its primary role is to regulate blood glucose levels and help convert glucose from the carbohydrates we eat into energy. 

In healthy individuals, beta cells release regular pulses of the hormone into the bloodstream. These pulses restrict the amount of glucose released by the liver, as well as propel body tissues to absorb the glucose that has been released.

However, in people with high blood glucose - or hyperglycemia, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes - the excess glucose suppresses the ""clock"" of beta cells that controls the rhythm of insulin pulses, reducing insulin production.

In the new study, McKenna and colleagues show how administering controlled pulses of glucose could normalize the production of insulin.

Firstly, the team created a mathematical model - the Dual Oscillator Model (DOM) - to simulate experiments with the islets of Langerhans, which are small clusters of pancreatic cells that contain insulin-producing beta cells.

The DOM model predicted that pulses of glucose to the bloodstream has the potential to reactivate the insulin clock within beta cells that has been halted by exposure to excess glucose.

The team then tested this theory in non-diabetic mice that had their islets of Langerhans removed.

Using a specially engineered microfluidic device, the researchers then delivered different concentrations of a glucose solution to the mouse islets.

As expected, when a high, steady glucose concentration was administered, the insulin clock within the mouse islets was deactivated.

When controlled pulses of glucose were applied to the islets, however, the insulin clock was restarted. What is more, when the flow of glucose solution followed a feedback loop that simulates the action of the liver, the team found the reactivated islets had the ability to recruit other islets and restart their insulin clock.

According to the researchers, their findings provide insight into the reduced insulin production that occurs in type 2 diabetes.
""This article demonstrates how microfluidics and mathematical modeling can be used together to gain new insights into the mechanisms for hormone secretion,"" says study co-author Richard Bertram, of the Department of Mathematics and Programs in Neuroscience and Molecular Biophysics at FSU.

Importantly, the authors say their study may also lead to new prevention strategies for type 2 diabetes:
""Here, we demonstrate, with a combined modeling and experimental approach, that the loss of pulsatile insulin release that results from elevated glucose may be recovered by an oscillatory glucose stimulus.

Our results have potential implications for enhancing insulin pulsatility and therefore mitigating the development of type 2 diabetes.""
In future research, the team plans to apply the microfluidic device to islets from diabetic mice, before studying islets from healthy humans and those with diabetes.

(Philadelphia, PA) - Smokers with a specific combination of two genetic variants may be more likely to remain abstinent and less prone to relapse when trying to  quit smoking , a study by researchers from the Tobacco Use Research Center of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine indicates.   

This research ? which will appear in the October issue of Health Psychology- has important implications for the development of more effective treatment strategies that are tailored to individual smokers' needs.   


'While previous research has examined the effects of genes related to dopamine, a chemical in the brain associated with reinforcing the effects of nicotine, this study provides the first evidence that genes that alter dopamine function may influence smoking cessation and relapse during treatment,' said lead author Caryn Lerman, Ph.D., Associate Director for Cancer Control and Population Science at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania and Professor in Penn's School of Medicine and the Annenberg Public Policy Center.
   
Dr. Lerman led a research team that examined 418 smokers enrolled in a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of bupropion for smoking cessation. Participants provided blood samples and received bupropion or  placebo  plus seven sessions of behavioral group counseling.    Smoking status, abstinence symptoms and side effects were recorded weekly, and smoking status was verified at the end of treatment and again at a six-month follow-up appointment.
   
Researchers found that participants with particular variants of the SLC6A3 dopamine transporter gene and the DRD2 dopamine receptor gene reported significantly higher abstinences rates and a longer time before relapse than smokers carrying other variants of these genes.    'This gene-gene interaction provides new evidence for the effects of dopamine genes on prospective smoking cessation and underscores the importance of not limiting genetic investigations of smoking behavior to single gene effects,' said Lerman. 
   
In previous research, the same variant of the dopamine transporter gene has been associated with higher levels of dopamine in the brain and this may facilitate smoking cessation.    'Future smoking cessation studies should evaluate genetic predisposition, as well as the influence of psychological and environmental factors that may promote relapse,' stated Lerman. 
   
This research will appear in Health Psychology in an article titled 'Effects of Dopamine Transporter and Receptor Polymorphisms on Smoking Cessation in a Bupropion Clinical Trial.' 
   
This research was funded by the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute on Drug Abuse and was conducted by the University of Pennsylvania/Georgetown University Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Center.

239,269327,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311409.php,Is Oatmeal Good for People with Diabetes?,Diabetes,Diabetes,Nutrition / Diet,,,1,1,1,3,1,1,4,1,3,4.0,1.0,2.0,,,,,,,"
Oatmeal, also known as porridge, is a popular breakfast food made from oats. There are several different types of oatmeal including rolled oats (old-fashioned), instant, and steel-cut.

All oatmeal starts with whole raw oats, which are harvested and cleaned. The outer shell, or hull, is removed, leaving the edible grain or ""groat"" behind. People can buy and consume oat groats, but they need to be cooked for 50-60 minutes to soften.

Steel-cut oats are made when the groats are chopped with a metal blade. Steel-cut oats cook more quickly - about 20-30 minutes - because they are further broken down.

Rolled oats or old-fashioned oatmeal is made by steaming and rolling the groats into flakes. This cuts cooking time down to 3-5 minutes.

Instant oats or ""quick oats"" are made by further steaming and rolling the oats, bringing the cook time down to as little as 30-60 seconds. 

The texture of steel-cut, old-fashioned, and instant oats differs widely, and which one is best is a personal preference. People who have tried quick oats and not enjoyed their softer texture should try the hardier steel-cut oats.

The nutritional profile of each cut of oats is the same when they are plain. However, many instant oats have added sugar and flavorings and are often high in sodium. Also, the higher the level of processing, the quicker the speed of digestion, and the higher the glycemic index, a measure of how quickly blood sugar rises when eating. 

Contents of this article:

Oatmeal is mainly a source of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates are converted to sugar when digested and increase sugar levels in the bloodstream. Carbohydrates that have fiber cause a slower release of sugar into the bloodstream, lowering the potential spike in blood sugar after a meal.

A diet that is high in processed carbohydrates, especially from sugar and packaged processed foods, increases the risk of blood sugar spikes after a meal because they are digested quickly.

Foods that digest quickly can cause quick blood sugar spikes and make it difficult to manage blood sugar levels, especially when eaten alone, which often happens at breakfast.

Vegetables, fruits, and whole grains contain complex carbohydrates that are full of fiber and nutrients that fuel the body and give sustained energy. 

People should form their meals and snacks around these healthy carbohydrates. Adding in some protein and healthy fat gives a nutritionally complete meal. Some foods contain all three of these components in one, while others may need to be paired up. Mixing proteins and fats with carbohydrates can further slow down digestion, which can help minimize spikes.

Oatmeal contains complex carbohydrate with little protein or fat. Healthy fats are a necessary part of the diet and help people feel full and satisfied. Protein helps to keep people fuller longer and will promote more stable blood sugar levels when paired with a complex carbohydrate. 

By combining a complex carbohydrate, lean protein, and healthy fat, people can reduce hunger and cravings while providing all three of the body's required macronutrients. 

First, start with one half cup of plain oats. Avoid pre-sweetened or flavored oats. Add a source of healthy fats like walnuts, almonds, chia seeds, hemp seeds, or pecans. As a bonus, nuts and seeds also add a little bit of protein.

People can cook their oats in milk or add milk to the oats after they are cooked for more protein. Cow's milk or soy milk are the best milks for an extra protein boost because almond milk and coconut milk are not good sources of protein. However, these also provide more carbohydrate.

The same is true for fruit. Fruit will add flavor but also carbohydrate which needs to be accounted for by people who manage their blood sugar by tracking carbohydrate grams.


Plain Greek yogurt is a low-carbohydrate option that may add some creaminess to the oatmeal. To jazz up the flavor, people can mix in a few drops of almond or vanilla extract, or sprinkle with cinnamon.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture National Nutrition Database, one-half cup of non-fortified, dry, instant oats contains:

One-half cup of uncooked instant oats also provides:

One packet of instant raisin and spice oatmeal has 15 grams of sugar and 210 milligrams of sodium per serving compared with the 0.4 grams of sugar and 0 grams of sodium in plain oats.

Oatmeal doesn't just have to be for breakfast and doesn't even have to be sweet. People with diabetes can enjoy savory oatmeal as well. Making savory oatmeal is a great way to switch up a normal oatmeal routine and make a quick, healthy, complete meal.

Vegetables like mushrooms, spinach, and green onions make great mix-ins, as well as spices like black pepper and cumin. Top with a small amount of shredded cheddar or parmesan and a fried pasture-raised egg.

People with diabetes should avoid instant oatmeals that are high in sugar or look for the less-processed options. Oatmeal can be a healthy breakfast option, especially when a protein and a healthy fat source are added for balance.

240,257169,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/298879.php,"Sugar consumption having a 'devastating' effect on all of our dental health, claims charity",Nutrition / Diet,Nutrition / Diet,Dentistry,,,1,4,1,4,3,2,4,4,4,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,"
Important changes need to be made at the highest level to urgently address the UK's deteriorating dental health from sugar consumption, an oral health charity says.

The British Dental Health Foundation is fully supporting new proposals made by one of the most outspoken voices in the campaign against excess sugar, chef Jamie Oliver.

As part of his new documentary looking into sugar consumption, Jamie's Sugar Rush, Mr Oliver took an in depth look into the devastating effects sugar consumption in having on our dental health, with particularly worrying signs seen on the effects it is having on the nation's children.

Dr Nigel Carter OBE, Chief Executive of the British Dental Health Foundation, highlighted why the charity is adding their voice to the calls for change: ""The effects that sugar consumption is having on children's dental health cannot be understated.  Shockingly, a recent study found half of eight year olds have visible signs of decay on their teeth and a third of children are starting school with visible signs of tooth decay.1

""These figures are alarming but are unfortunately only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the effect sugar is having on dental health.  More regularly we are hearing first-hand accounts from dental professionals about just how children are suffering due to sugar and this is being played out in every dental surgery across the country.

""Tooth decay is the number one reason for hospitalisation in children and while we cannot blame the food and drink industry entirely, they do have to take a sizable portion of the blame. We believe that if decisive action is not taken soon, then all of our dental health, not just children's, will continue to suffer the consequences.

""Mr Oliver has highlighted the fact that 26,000 primary school aged children were admitted to hospital due to tooth decay last year2, with children tooth extractions costing the NHS around £30 million per year, the key cause being tooth decay.  This cannot be allowed to continue.""

Tooth decay happens when sugar reacts with the bacteria in plaque.  This forms the acids that attack the teeth and destroy the enamel.  After this happens many times, the tooth enamel may break down, forming a hole or 'cavity'.  Tooth decay almost always leads to fillings and often leads to teeth having to be extracted.

Early tooth decay can have no obvious symptoms, but your dental team may be able to spot a cavity in its early stages when they examine your teeth.  This is why you should visit your dental team regularly, as small cavities are much easier to treat than advanced decay.

""We now have the public's attention in the battle against sugar more than ever before and need to use this platform to force through important changes,"" added Dr Carter.

""We cannot trust the food and drink industry to make the necessary changes themselves - more radical action is required. We are supporting all of the measures which Mr Oliver has set out in 'Jamie's Sugar Manifesto' and believe lobbying the government for the introduction of these can make a serious difference to our dental health.""

Measures which are outlined within 'Jamie's Sugar Manifesto', which the British Dental Health Foundation endorses, include:

Dr Carter added: ""As well as these measures we also support Mr Oliver's move to add a 10 pence child health levy on sugary sweetened drinks within his restaurants.

""By lobbying other restaurant to adopt this small measure we will be able to start a dialogue which will effect real change and lead to oral health benefits for generations to come.""",0

A new breed of permanently \'cheerful\' mouse is providing hope of a new treatment for clinical  depression . TREK-1 is a gene that can affect transmission of  serotonin  in the brain. Serotonin is known to play an important role in mood, sleep and sexuality. By breeding mice with an absence of TREK-1, researchers were able create a depression-resistant strain. The details of this research, which involved an international collaboration with scientists from the University of Nice, France, are published in Nature Neuroscience this week.
   
\""Depression is a devastating illness, which affects around 10% of people at some point in their life,\"" says Dr. Guy Debonnel an MUHC psychiatrist, professor in the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University, and principal author of the new research. \""Current medications for clinical depression are ineffective for a third of patients, which is why the development of alternate treatments is so important.\""
   
Mice without the TREK-1 gene (\'knock-out\' mice) were created and bred in collaboration with Dr. Michel Lazdunski, co-author of the research, in his laboratory at the University of Nice, France. \""These \'knock-out\' mice were then tested using separate behavioral, electrophysiological and biochemical measures known to gauge \'depression\' in animals,\"" says Dr. Debonnel. \""The results really surprised us; our \'knock-out\' mice acted as if they had been treated with  antidepressants  for at least three weeks.\""
   
This research represents the first time depression has been eliminated through genetic alteration of an organism. \""The discovery of a link between TREK-1 and depression could ultimately lead to the development of a new generation of antidepressant drugs,\"" noted Dr. Debonnel.
   
According to Health Canada and Statistics Canada, approximately 8% of Canadians will suffer from depression at some point in their lifetime. Around 5% of Canadians seek medical advice for depression each year; a figure that has almost doubled in the past decade. Figures in the U.S. are comparable, with approximately 18.8 million American adults (about 9.5% of the population) suffering depression during their life.

Pain is a sensation that hurts. It may cause discomfort, distress or agony. It may be steady or throbbing. It may be 

stabbing, aching, or pinching. However you feel pain, only you can describe it or define it. Because pain is so individual, 

your pain cannot be ""checked out"" by anyone else.    
Pain may be acute or chronic. Acute pain is severe and lasts a relatively short time. It is usually a signal that body tissue 

is being injured in some way, and the pain generally disappears when the injury heals. Chronic pain may range from mild to 

severe, and it is present to some degree for long periods of time.    
 What Causes Pain For People With Cancer?    
 Cancer  patients may have pain for a variety of reasons. It may be due to the effects of the cancer itself, or it could result 

from treatment methods. For example, after surgery a person feels pain as a result of the operation itself.    
Or the pain could be unrelated to the cancer - a muscle sprain, a toothache, or a  headache . Remember that not all people with 

cancer have pain. And those who do are not in pain all the time.    
Cancer pain may depend on the type of cancer, the stage (extent) of the disease, and your pain threshold (or tolerance for 

pain). Cancer pain that lasts a few days or longer may result from:    
-- Poor blood circulation because the cancer has blocked blood vessels.    
-- The  tumor  causing pressure on organs, nerves, or bone.    
-- Blockage of an organ or tube in the body.    
-- Metastasis - cancer cells that have spread to other sites in the body.    
-- Infection or  inflammation .    
-- Side effects from  chemotherapy ,  radiation therapy  , or surgery.    
-- Stiffness from inactivity.    
-- Psychological responses to illness such as tension,  depression , or  anxiety .    
Whatever the cause, pain can be relieved����

A virus turns lymph vessel cells into a  cancer  that affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those who are  HIV  positive, according to research published today in Nature Genetics*.   

A Cancer Research UK team based at University College London have discovered that  Kaposi sarcoma  - which is common in people who are HIV positive or have had an organ transplant - first develops in the inner cell lining of lymph vessels, the transport network for the body's immune system. 
   
The findings indicate that drugs arresting the development of cells lining lymph vessels could prove powerful against Kaposi sarcoma. They could also yield a test for doctors to predict which patients are likely to develop this cancer. 
   
Kaposi sarcoma typically appears as coloured lesions or blotches on the skin, although it can spread to internal organs. 
   
The  sarcoma  is the most common cancer in individuals with HIV or  AIDS  and for that reason is the most common cancer in many Sub-Saharan African countries. It is also one of the most common cancers in patients who have had their immune system suppressed to lower the likelihood that their bodies will reject a transplanted organ.
   
Professor Boshoff, who is joint Director of the Cancer Research UK Viral Oncology Group at UCL, says: ""The cell type in which Kaposi sarcoma first develops has been a mystery since it was discovered in 1872. 
   
""We analysed the genetic makeup of Kaposi sarcoma cells and found they are most similar genetically to cells of the inner lining of lymph vessels, known as lymphatic endothelial cells."" 
   
The research was funded by Cancer Research UK, with additional funding from the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust. 
   
The team also found that the virus that causes Kaposi sarcoma - the Kaposi sarcoma  herpes  virus (KSHV) - can turn the endothelial cells that line blood vessels into cancerous lymphatic endothelial cells. 
   
Professor Boshoff adds: ""We have shown for the first time that a virus can genetically reprogramme blood vessel endothelial cells into lymphatic endothelial cells, and that it is these lymphatic cells that develop into Kaposi sarcoma.""
   
""Now that we know in which type of cell Kaposi sarcoma originates, we should be able to identify new ways to treat the condition. The findings could also yield new clues about other cancers that are triggered by viruses, such as  cervical cancer ."" 
   
The new study suggests that drugs inhibiting the growth of the lymphatic endothelium could prove a successful new way of combating Kaposi sarcoma. Such drugs are already being developed.
   
The research also points towards a new predictive test for Kaposi sarcoma. 
   
The team found that high levels of circulating growth factors which encourage lymphatic endothelial cells to proliferate were strongly associated with the development of Kaposi sarcoma. 
   
Professor Boshoff adds: ""Finding new cancers early is vital if treatment is to be successful. By testing blood for growth factors that encourage the cells lining lymph vessels to grow, doctors might be able to predict which high-risk patients - such as those with HIV or who have had an organ transplant - will subsequently develop Kaposi sarcoma."" 
   
Professor Robert Souhami, Director of Clinical and External Affairs at Cancer Research UK, says: ""People with HIV or who are taking immunosuppressive drugs are particularly susceptible to cancer."" 
   
""Chris Boshoff and his team's discovery that Kaposi sarcoma originates in the cellular lining of lymph vessels furthers our understanding of the disease and also has strong therapeutic implications. 
   
""This is a good example of how research into the basic workings of cells and viruses can open new avenues of opportunity for treatment.""

Notes for editors    
Kaposi sarcoma causes tumours to develop in the tissues below the skin surface, or in the mucous membranes of the mouth or nose. The lesions appear as raised blotches or nodules that may be purple, brown or red in colour.   

Whereas most cancers begin in one place in the body and may then spread around the body, Kaposi sarcoma can appear in several parts of the body at the same time.    

Kaposi sarcoma commonly disappears if the immune system is restored. It can otherwise lead to potentially fatal intestinal and lung lesions.    

Scientists are currently trying to understand Kaposi sarcoma better in order to find new ways of treating it in patients whose immune systems are chronically low.

The study evaluated the core food intake of more than 430 South Australian children aged 9-10. The results -- published recently in the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics - show that 45% of the children's daily energy intake was sourced from discretionary foods high in fat, salt and sugar.

""We found that children obtained over half of their daily energy from carbohydrates and about one-third of their energy from fats, half of which was saturated fat,"" says lead author Dr Melissa Whitrow from the University of Adelaide's School of Public Health and the Robinson Research Institute.

""We know that an unhealthy diet is a key contributor to obesity and also paves the way for other health problems in later life, such as poor cardiovascular health. The establishment and maintenance of healthy eating habits during the transition from childhood to adolescence is also very important.""

The study uncovered a number of issues, such as:

   
""At this stage in their lives, girls need to eat more dairy as they head towards puberty, as this is important for their bone density,"" Dr Whitrow says.

""Variety of food is also an issue. Red meat tended to be the dominant meat, whereas fish should be consumed in a healthy diet at least weekly. It's important for families to understand that processed meat is a discretionary food, not a core food, and is often high in salt and fat.""

Dr Whitrow says socio-economic status made little difference to the dietary problems highlighted in the study.

""Based on the results of our study, there is much to be done to encourage 9-to-10-year-old children and their families to make healthier food choices. For example, substituting at least one high-fat, high-sugar or high-salt food item with a healthier food choice in the school lunchbox each day might make a difference,"" she says.

""This isn't about blaming the parents. As a community we need to help parents more. We need to look at what's being advertised to their children, and how we can encourage children to try different foods. Providing healthy alternatives into a lunch box and more vegetables at the dinner table would be a good start.""

This study has been conducted in collaboration with the University of Newcastle, and was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Australian Research Council (ARC).

A large breakfast containing whey protein may help manage Type 2 diabetes, new research from Israel reports. The study results were presented Friday, April 1, at ENDO 2016, the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society, in Boston.

""A high-calorie protein breakfast, medium-sized lunch and small dinner is a proven successful strategy for weight loss, improved satiety and reduced glucose spikes throughout the day in people with obesity and Type 2 diabetes,"" said lead study author Daniela Jakubowicz, MD, professor of medicine at Tel Aviv University.

""However, the benefits of high protein content at breakfast also depend on the protein source and quality,"" Jakubowicz said. ""Whey protein powder, which is a byproduct of milk during cheese production, induced greater satiety and reduction of glucose spikes after meals compared to other protein sources, such as eggs, soy or tuna.""

Jakubowicz and her colleagues investigated whether in overweight and obese people with Type 2 diabetes, whey protein for breakfast is more effective than other proteins for weight loss, satiety and reduction of glucose spikes and HbA1C (glycated hemoglobin) levels.

They randomly assigned 48 overweight and obese participants with Type 2 diabetes who were, on average, 59 years of age, to one of three diets that contained the same number of calories.

For 23 months, all participants ate a large breakfast, medium-sized lunch and small dinner, but the breakfast composition, amount and source of proteins differed among the groups.

One group ate breakfast containing mostly whey protein such as whey protein shakes, the second group ate breakfast containing other proteins including eggs, soy and tuna, and the third ate breakfast high in carbohydrates or starch.

After 12 weeks, the group on whey protein lost the most weight: 7.6 kg (16.7 pounds), compared to 6.1 kg (13.4 pounds) for those on the other proteins, and 3.1 kg (6.8 pounds) for those in the carbohydrate group.

Whey protein diet participants were more satiated and less hungry throughout the day, with lower glucose spikes after meals compared to the other two diets, and their HbA1C also decreased more than with the other two diets.

""The whey protein diet significantly suppresses the hunger hormone 'ghrelin.' A whey protein drink is easily prepared and provides the advantages of a high-protein breakfast on weight loss, reduction of hunger, glucose spikes and HbA1c,"" Jakubowicz said.

Gorging at a holiday meal or friend's BBQ might have more to do with your ego than the quality of the food - especially if you're a man.

A new Cornell Food and Brand Lab study finds that men are at particular risk of overeating in social situations even when there is no incentive to do so. ""Even if men aren't thinking about it, eating more than a friend tends to be understood as a demonstration of virility and strength,"" explains co-author Kevin Kniffin, PhD.

For the study published in Frontiers in Nutrition, researchers recruited college aged students of similar weight to participate in either a competitive chicken wing eating challenge with cheering spectators, or a competitive chicken wing eating challenge with no spectators. The prize for eating the most wings was a worthless plastic medal, but competitors still ate about 4 times more food than normal. Men who ate in front of spectators ate 30% more than those without spectators and described the experience as challenging, cool and exhilarating. Women, on the other hand, ate less with spectators than without them and described the experience as slightly embarrassing.

""Focus on your friends and not the food,"" suggests lead author, Brian Wansink, PhD, Director of the Cornell Food and Brand Lab and author of Slim by Design. He notes that these findings have obvious implications - from tailgates, to holidays, to all-you-can-eat night - and concludes, ""If you want to prove how macho you are, challenge your friend to a healthy arm wrestle instead of trying to out-eat him.""

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by poor attention, impulsive behavior, and hyperactivity.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of 2011, approximately 11 percent of children aged between 4 and 17 in the United States have received a diagnosis of ADHD, making it one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood.

Although the precise causes of ADHD are unclear, previous research has suggested that a poor diet may play a role. Some studies have also indicated that healthful diets could help to prevent or treat ADHD, though other research has challenged this theory.

For the new study, team leader María Izquierdo Pulido, of the Faculty of Pharmacy and Food Sciences of the University of Barcelona in Spain, and colleagues investigated whether a Mediterranean diet might be associated with lower ADHD diagnosis.

""To our knowledge, there are no studies that examined the potential relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and ADHD,"" the authors note.

The Mediterranean diet is typically high in fruits, vegetables, fish, whole grains, nuts, and legumes, and low in red meats, eggs, dairy products, and sweets.

A Mediterranean diet is considered by many as the optimal diet for good health, with studies linking this eating pattern to reduced risk of heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and some types of cancer.

To determine whether this diet may be effective against ADHD, Pulido and team analyzed the data of 60 children and adolescents aged between 6 and 16 who had been diagnosed with ADHD. These children were matched by age and sex to 60 children without ADHD.

The dietary patterns of the two groups were assessed using food frequency questionnaires, and the team used the KIDMED test to calculate the children's adherence to a Mediterranean diet.

Compared with children who had high adherence to a Mediterranean diet, those with a low adherence were more likely to have received a diagnosis of ADHD, the researchers report.

Furthermore, the team identified a higher prevalence of ADHD among children who consumed high amounts of candy and sugary drinks, but low amounts of fatty fish.

While the researchers say that their study cannot conclude that a Mediterranean diet protects against ADHD, they say that their findings do indicate that poor dietary patterns may be linked to the disorder.

The authors conclude:
""The current findings suggest that certain dietary habits may play a role in ADHD development, even though further work is required to investigate causality and to determine if dietary manipulation could reverse the symptoms of ADHD, taking into consideration all potential factors. 

Therefore, our main recommendation is that clinicians focus on diet not with the expectation of dietary changes improving behavior but with the concern that children with ADHD are more likely to be eating unhealthy diets; this component should therefore be part of the evaluation to improve their health.""

Researchers found that children and adolescents who consumed high amounts of fructose - most commonly from sweetened drinks - were more likely to have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Senior investigator Dr. Valerio Nobili, of the Bambino Gesù Hospital in Italy, and colleagues recently reported their findings in the Journal of Hematology.

NAFLD is a condition characterized by a buildup of fat in the liver that is not caused by alcohol consumption. In NASH, the fat buildup is accompanied by inflammation and liver cell damage, which can cause scarring, or fibrosis. NASH can lead to severe complications, including cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Excess weight is a leading risk factor for NAFLD and NASH. According to Dr. Nobili and colleagues, estimates suggest that up to 9.6 percent of all children and 38 percent of obese children in Western countries have some form of liver disease, including NASH.

According to the researchers, previous studies have indicated that dietary fructose intake leads to an increase in blood levels of uric acid, and high levels of both fructose and uric acid have been identified in people with NAFLD.

For this latest study, Dr. Nobili and team set out to investigate whether fructose and uric acid might be independently associated with NASH.

""Numerous studies have shown that high uric acid levels are associated with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD, but to date, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have tested the independence of associations among uric acid concentrations, fructose consumption, and NASH confirmed by biopsy,"" notes Dr. Nobili.

To reach their findings, the researchers studied 271 obese children and adolescents who had NAFLD, all of whom underwent a liver biopsy.

All participants completed a food frequency questionnaire, which disclosed precisely what foods they consumed, how often they consumed them, and the portion size.

Using these data, the team calculated the participants' dietary fructose intake. They found that soda and other sweetened drinks were a major source of fructose; almost 90 percent of subjects reported drinking soda and other sweetened beverages at least once weekly.

Morning and afternoon snacks consisting of pizza, crackers, yogurt, and salty snacks were a regular occurrence for almost 95 percent of the participants, the team reports.

From the liver biopsies, the researchers found that 37.6 percent of the children and adolescents had NASH.

Of these, 47 percent had high concentrations of uric acid, compared with 29.7 percent of participants without NASH. 

Importantly, the team found that fructose intake was independently associated with high uric acid concentrations, and fructose intake was more frequent among participants with NASH than those without NASH.
""In this study, we show for the first time that uric acid concentrations and dietary fructose consumption are independently and positively associated with NASH. 

The development of NASH may markedly affect life expectancy and quality of life in affected individuals and therefore it is crucial to understand the risk factors for NASH in children and adolescents in order to design effective interventions which can be used safely to treat this young group of patients.""Dr. Valerio Nobili
The researchers add that greater efforts should be made to reduce the consumption of soda and other sweetened drinks among children and adolescents, which may lower fructose intake.

Exercise has a similar effect to  antidepressants  on  depression . This has been shown by previous research. Now Astrid Bjornebekk at Karolinska Institutet has explained how this can happen: exercise stimulates the production of new brain cells.
   
In a series of scientific reports, she has searched for the underlying biological mechanisms that explain why exercise can be a form of therapy for depression and has also compared it with pharmacological treatment with an SSRI drug.
   
The experiment studies were conducted on rats. The results show that both exercise and antidepressants increase the formation of new cells in an area of the brain that is important to memory and learning. Astrid Bjornebekk's studies confirm previous research results, and she proposes a model to explain how exercise can have an antidepressant effect in mild to moderately severe depression. Her study also shows that exercise is a very good complement to medicines.
   
""What is interesting is that the effect of antidepressant therapy can be greatly strengthened by external environmental factors,"" she says.
   
Previous studies have shown that drug abusers have lowered levels of the dopamine D2 receptor in the brain's reward system. It has been speculated that this may be of significance to the depressive symptoms drug abusers often suffer from. These rat studies show that genetic factors may influence how external environmental factors can regulate levels of the dopamine D2 receptor in the brain.
   
""Different individuals may have differing sensitivity to how  stress  lowers dopamine D2 receptor levels, for example. This might be significant in explaining why certain individuals develop depression more readily than others,"" she says.

The analysis of almost 20,000 adults in the United States indicates that around two thirds of coffee drinkers and one third of tea drinkers add sugar, cream, flavored syrups, and other high-calorie substances to their beverages.

Study co-author Prof. Ruopeng An, of the College of Applied Health Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and colleagues calculated just how much these additives are increasing U.S. individuals' daily calorie intake.

The researchers report their findings in the journal Public Health.

According to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, it is estimated that men aged between 18 and 55 who are moderately active should consume approximately 2,600-2,800 calories daily, while moderately active women of the same age should consume around 2,000-2,200 calories per day.

When a person has a lack of energy balance - that is, more calories are consumed than burned - this can lead to overweight and obesity.

In relation to coffee and tea, the Dietary Guidelines state that the beverages can be consumed as part of a healthful diet, but that additional calories from additives should be accounted for.

For their study, Prof. An and team set out to determine the nutritional implications of additives in tea and coffee, given that they are two of the most commonly consumed beverages in the U.S.

""Unlike other popular beverages, including alcohol and other sweetened beverages that are typically consumed in isolation, many people prefer drinking coffee and tea with add-ins like sugar and cream,"" the authors note.

""These add-in items are often dense in energy and fat but low in nutritional value,"" they add.

To reach their findings, the researchers analyzed data from the 2001-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The data included 13,185 adults who reported consuming coffee and 6,215 adults who reported consuming tea in the 24 hours before being surveyed.

The results indicate that 51.4 percent of U.S. adults consume coffee on any given day, while 25.8 percent of adults in the country drink tea on any given day.

Among coffee drinkers, the data revealed that 67.5 percent consume coffee with add-ins, while 33.4 percent of tea drinkers consume their beverage with add-ins.

For coffee drinkers, sugar, cream, sugar and cream substitutes, half-and-half, and whole or reduced-fat milk were the most common add-ins. Sugar, sugar substitutes, honey, and whole or reduced-fat milk were the most popular add-ins for tea drinkers.

The researchers then looked at how many extra calories these add-ins account for each day.

Compared with adults who drank black coffee, the team found that those who put sweeteners, cream, and other additives in their coffee consumed an average of 69 extra calories daily. Around 60 percent of these calories came from sugar, Prof. An notes, while the majority of the remaining calories came from fat.

Among tea drinkers, individuals who put additives in their beverage consumed an average of 43 extra calories daily, compared with those who did not put add-ins in their tea. Almost 85 percent of the calories from add-ins came from sugar, the team reports.

While the researchers admit that the number of extra calories from additives in tea and coffee is small, if consumed every day, they can easily add up and contribute to weight gain.
""Our findings indicate that a lot of coffee and tea drinkers regularly use caloric add-ins to improve the flavor of their beverages, but possibly without fully realizing or taking into consideration its caloric and nutritional implications.""Prof. Ruopeng An

Developmental psychologist Maria Pagano, PhD, found adolescents with severe alcohol and other drug (AOD) problems have a low regard for others, as indicated by higher rates of driving under the influence and having unprotected sex with a history of sexually transmitted disease. The findings also showed that they are less likely to volunteer their time helping others, an activity that she has been shown to help adult alcoholics stay sober.

The study was published in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Substance Abuse.

Pagano, an associate professor of psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, had a major challenge in designing this study: adolescents are self-centered. But she was convinced that she would find addiction tied to a deficit in awareness of others above and beyond the ego-centric stage of adolescence. And she did.

She recruited 585 adolescents from Cuyahoga County high schools and the largest residential treatment facility in Northeastern Ohio, and matched them by age, gender, race, and residence zip code. There were two adolescents who described little or no drug or alcohol use (n=390) for every one young addict (n=195). The study was designed to consider the relationship between the severity of the addiction and regard for others. She identified several behaviors to measure other-oriented awareness: driving under the influence, engaging in unprotected sex (even when they knew they had a sexually transmitted disease), and volunteerism.

Results showed a dose-response relationship between substance use severity and other-regard: the more severe the addiction, the more likely the young person was to endorse indices of low-regard for others. She likens it to some of the features of autism.

Most youths (88%) did not use alcohol or drugs at the time of their last intercourse, which was unprotected among 55% of the sample, and one out of five youths (26%) had a history of a driving under the influence, or DUI. The results showed a dose-response relationship between AOD severity and an increased likelihood of a DUI and having unprotected sex. Youths with a STD history who did not use protection at the time of last sex were more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for substance dependency (OR=2.1) than youths with moderate use (R=1.6), whose risk was greater than youths who had never used alcohol or drugs (OR=1.1).

Pagano believes that alcoholics and drug addicts may be hindered by a low awareness of how their actions impact others. ""The addict is like a tornado running through the lives of others,"" said Pagano. Even when they are in recovery there is little indication that they understand how their actions impact those around them. ""This is part of the illness,"" she added. Helping young people to get out of that self-centeredness in the service of others helps them in the recovery process. Service to others is a big part of the 12-step Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous programs.

The psychologist demonstrated in previous work with adult addicts that service cuts the risk of relapse in half and also cuts in half the risk of arrest. ""People must understand that the illness has a low awareness of others component that must be addressed,"" she added. Her work suggests that addiction could be prevented through strengthening volunteerism.

Pagano's continued research in this area is exploring how helping others may increase alcoholics' sensitivity to others and how their actions affect others. Following the treated addicts over a one-year period and monitoring their commitment to service will allow her to see whether their volunteerism helped reduce risky behaviors, she said.

252,272788,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/314899.php,Cured meats can worsen asthma symptoms,Pulmonary System,Pulmonary System,Nutrition / Diet,Obesity / Weight Loss / Fitness,,5,1,2,4,1,4,1,1,1,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,,"
Cured meats are the latest dietary pariah - and for good reason. Over recent years, studies have racked up a fearsome list of their deleterious effects on health and longevity.

In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently declared them carcinogenic.

Not only do cured meats increase cancer risk, they also raise the risk of coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes.

As far as lung health is concerned, the grim theme continues. Increased consumption of salami and other such meats has been tied to lung cancer, decreased lung function, and increased symptoms and incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

A recent study, published in the journal Thorax, set out to identify whether cured meat consumption also had a negative impact on asthma. To date, only two studies have specifically looked at this interaction, and both of them found no effect. 

The group reopened the investigation into asthma and cured meats, as well as set out to understand the role of obesity in worsening asthma symptoms.

Researchers believe that there are at least two pathways by which cured meats damage tissues in the body. Firstly, they are high in nitrites, which can lead to nitrosative stress and oxidative stress, both of which damage cells.

Secondly, there is a relationship between consuming cured meats and increased levels of C-reactive protein, a key player in the immune system. C-reactive protein can induce inflammation, resulting in tissue damage over time.

Taking data from the French Epidemiological study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA), 971 adult participants were used. The EGEA has tracked asthma patients using questionnaires and medical examinations for more than 20 years. 

Data on diet, weight, and asthma symptoms were collected.  Demographic information and other lifestyle factors were also collated, such as level of exercise, smoking, sex, age, and educational attainment.

On average, participants ate 2.5 servings of cured meat per week. Those who ate one or less per week were classified as low consumers, people consuming one to four weekly servings were classified as medium, and they were classified as high if they consumed more than four.

The initial data was collected between 2003 and 2007, and a follow-up was carried out between 2011 and 2013. Overall, asthma had worsened in 20 percent of the group, improved in 27 percent, and seen no change in the remaining 53 percent.

When cured meat intake was examined, the researchers found that 14 percent of low consumers, 20 percent of medium consumers, and 22 percent of high consumers had worsening symptoms.

Once other factors were controlled - smoking, regular physical activity, age, sex, and educational attainment - those who ate the most cured meats were 76 percent more likely to have experienced worsening asthma symptoms than those who ate the lowest amount of cured meats.

The team was also interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the role that obesity plays in asthma. Being overweight has previously been linked to worse asthma symptoms, but in the present study, body mass index (BMI) accounted for only 14 percent of worsening symptoms. This suggests that the consumption of cured meats has an independent influence on asthma, above and beyond weight.

It is important to note that this is an observational study, and conclusions regarding cause and effect cannot be drawn. Also, as the authors point out, the results were reliant on participants' memories. Additionally, symptom scores could have been affected by smoking or by COPD, which shares many symptoms with asthma.

That being said, other previous research has shown links between processed meats and lung health, so the current work adds to the weight of evidence.

People who crave chocolate when they are depressed are more likely to have a 'neurotic' than an 'introverted' type of personality, a new study from Australia has found. Over half of the depressed people surveyed reported food cravings, nearly all of them specifically craving chocolate. More women than men craved chocolate when depressed.    
  
  Published in the October 2007 issue of the  British Journal of Psychiatry , the study examined links between chocolate craving in people who are depressed and both personality style and 'atypical' depressive symptoms. Atypical  depression  is a depressive syndrome combining symptom and personality criteria.    
  
  This study investigated the self-reported benefits of chocolate during a depressive episode, and looked to see whether there was any particular type of personality that tended to crave chocolate to alleviate symptoms.    
  
  A web-based questionnaire was completed by nearly 3000 people reporting clinical depression (experiencing depressive symptoms for more than 2 weeks and requiring treatment). Their average age was 40, and over 70% were female. Over 73% had previously received  antidepressant  medication, and over 78% counselling or psychotherapy for depressive episodes.    
  
  It was found that when depressed, over 54% of respondents reported food cravings, with nearly 45% specifically craving chocolate (nearly 51% of the women and almost 31% of the men).    
  
  Of the chocolate craving group, nearly 61% of those who rated chocolate's capacity to improve their depressed mood as moderately to very important were more likely to rate it as making them feel significantly less anxious and less irritated.   
  
  Temperament and personality questionnaire scores showed the chocolate craving group to have significantly higher average scores on the irritability, rejection sensitivity, anxious worrying, self-criticism, and self-focused scales -measures of  neuroticism . Differences were not found on scales measuring introversion, such as personal reserve, social avoidance and perfectionism.    
  
  Further analysis showed that irritability and rejection sensitivity were the only two significant predictors of chocolate craving. Those identified as chocolate cravers had higher scores for appetite increase, weight gain, sensitivity to rejection, oversleeping, and limbs feeling 'heavy like lead'.   
  
  The simple question of depression-associated chocolate craving appeared to be associated with atypical depression symptoms.    
  
  The researchers comment that their most intriguing finding was the specific link between chocolate craving and personality style. Their results suggest that personality style dictates the craving for chocolate when people are in states of 'emotional dysregulation' (anxious and irritable, and not only depressed).    
  
  As individuals with certain personality styles find comfort eating chocolate improves their mood, such behaviour may reflect biological mechanisms which 'soothe' their personality-based capacity to experience emotional dysregulation.

Over a thousand men a year now die as a result of  skin cancer  in the United Kingdom.  Of 1,777 people who died last year, 1,002 were men.  Experts say men are less likely to check their moles than women.  The incidence of skin cancer among UK males has risen by 42% during the last decade.    

More women than men are diagnosed with  melanoma  - skin cancer.  However, more men die because women are getting treatment earlier on during the  cancer's  development.    

The thicker a mole has become, the more likely it will be more difficult to treat successfully.  According to Cancer Research UK, men are going to their doctors when the melanoma is already quite thick.    


According to research carried out by Cancer Research UK, 60% of men never check their backs for new or changing moles.  Although one third of English men have experienced  sunburn , 70% think they are not at risk of skin cancer.    

If skin cancer is detected early, the patient's chances of survival are much better.    

Every twelve years the number of people getting skin cancer worldwide doubles.  Over-exposure to sunlight raises the risk of developing skin cancer.    

Some studies have also shown that regular exposure to some sunlight can actually protect from some cancers.  The risk for skin cancer is over-exposure.    Written by Christian Nordqvist ",0

Nearly 10 per cent of teens in three Canadian provinces said they had gambled online in the past three months, according to a new study by researchers from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and the University of Waterloo. It's the first Canadian-based study to find such high levels of online gambling among youth.

Of all adolescents surveyed, 42 per cent reported that they had gambled money or something of value in offline (land-based) gambling or online gambling. Popular gambling activities included: a dare or challenge (22 per cent), instant-win or scratch tickets (14 per cent), games of skill, such as pool or darts (12 per cent), offline sports pools (9 per cent), and cards, such as poker and black jack (9 per cent).

""A substantially high proportion of young people are gambling in general, and mostly in unregulated forms, like in a dare or a game of pool, which are accessible to youth,"" says Dr. Tara Elton-Marshall, Scientist in Social and Epidemiological Research at CAMH and first author of the study, which was published this month in BMC Public Health. ""The high proportion of teens who are gambling in any form is concerning because there is research to suggest that the earlier people start to gamble, the more likely it is to be an issue later on.""

The findings come from 10,035 students in grades 9 to 12 (aged 13 to 19) who completed the 2012-2013 Youth Gambling Survey in schools in Ontario, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador.

Most adolescents participating in many forms of gambling, with the exception of gambling on lottery tickets and instant-win or scratch tickets, were not of legal age to gamble.

Online gamblers were adolescents who reported gambling in online sports pools, Internet poker or Internet slot machines. While the study did not ask where teens were gambling online, venues could include unregulated offshore gambling websites or informal forums set up among friends and peers, says Dr. Elton-Marshall.

The higher rates of online gambling may partly be explained by the fact that adolescents were specifically asked about online sports pools, which may not have been considered a form of gambling by teens responding to previous surveys about online gambling.

The study, the first to use a problem gambling scale created specifically for adolescents, showed potential reasons for concern, particularly related to adolescents who were gambling both online and offline.

Among these adolescents, 36 per cent had a score indicating a potential gambling problem on a scale measuring problem gambling, versus 8 per cent among offline-only gamblers. Problem gambling severity scores were calculated based on responses to nine questions, such as how often teens missed activities such as team sports or band due to gambling/betting.

""While we do not know why adolescents who also gamble online had higher problem gambling scores, we also found that adolescents who were also gambling online were more likely than offline-only gamblers to participate in multiple forms of gambling,"" says Dr. Elton-Marshall. ""This suggests that young people who are also gambling online are individuals who are seeking out a range of gambling experiences, which could put them at greater risk for problem gambling.""

Teens also participated in free simulated forms of gambling online, including free poker websites and gambling games on Facebook.

""The gambling landscape is shifting so rapidly in terms of technology and the proliferation of gambling experiences,"" says Dr. Elton-Marshall.

Four provinces - Ontario, B.C., Manitoba and Quebec - have also legalized online gambling. This study provides a baseline of adolescents' online gambling behaviour before the January 2015 launch of Ontario's PlayOLG Website, which is strictly regulated to ensure participants are 18 years or older.

""Continuing to assess how the expanding and evolving gambling landscape is affecting young people is critical to help prevent gambling problems,"" says Dr. Elton-Marshall.

The results of a UK study presented at the European League Against Rheumatism Annual Congress (EULAR 2016) showed that tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (anti-TNF) treatment is effective at improving both muscle and skin involvement in children with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM). These findings bring new hope to JDM patients who have failed to respond to multiple drug treatments and who, as a result, have a greater risk of painful complications and premature death.

JDM is a rare chronic autoimmune disease of children characterised by inflammation of the muscles, skin and other organs. , In the UK, the reported incidence of JDM is two to three cases per million children younger than 16 years old, with a median age at onset of 6.8 years; JDM is more common in girls than boys, by a ratio of approximately 2.3:1. Characteristic findings include skin rash, skin ulceration, and muscle weakness.2,3

In general, children with JDM are able to lead normal lives; however, some patients with JDM have a disease course that is refractory to multiple drug treatments. For those children where treatments have failed, prolonged disease activity has been shown to be associated with increased mortality and complications, such as scarring, pain due to trapped nerves, and shortening of the muscles causing joints to stay bent.

""High levels of the cell signalling protein TNF have been reported in JDM patients with a long disease course, suggesting this immune cell regulator may play a significant role in refractory disease,"" said Dr Raquel Campanilho-Marques of the Institute of Child Health, University College London, UK. ""There are no published clinical trials (only case reports) of this therapy, but some are in progress. Our study is one of the largest to explore the efficacy and safety of anti-TNF therapy in a large independent cohort of JDM patients.""

Evaluation of 66 patients with JDM, recruited from the UK JDM Cohort and Biomarker Study and actively treated with anti-TNF agents, showed significant improvements in muscle and skin involvement, as well as in overall disease activity. There were significant changes in the median values of two standard muscle measurements: the Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale and Manual Muscle Testing (p

Around one quarter of the patients in this study switched their anti-TNF treatment, with just under two-thirds of these switches due to therapy failure, one quarter due to adverse events and one eighth due to patient preference for subcutaneous administration. Of 21 adverse reactions registered, seven were considered severe (anaphylactic reactions on infliximab infusion). Three quarters of the mild to moderate adverse reactions were due to infection; in four of which, the patient was switched to another TNF antagonist, while in the remaining patients, temporarily withholding the drug proved sufficient. No cases of TB were registered.

The two conditions often go together but should not just be treated with  antidepressants  alone, study finds -    
 Depression  often causes a duet of anguish among people already suffering from chronic pain. But the two conditions retain 

their independence from one another, and this may explain why medications used to treat patients' depression might not help 

them manage their pain, a new study says.    
Researchers at the University of Michigan Health System and the University of Cologne, Germany, have used functional imaging 

of the brain to determine that in patients with the chronic pain syndrome  fibromyalgia , their level of depression has little 

influence on the intensity of pain they experience. This could be one of the reasons that treating a patient's depression by 

prescribing an antidepressant that has no analgesic (pain-killing) properties may have little or no impact on their pain. 

   
The study, in the May issue of Arthritis & Rheumatism, notes that doctors often lump together the two conditions when they 

treat patients experiencing both of them. Some 30 to 54 percent of people with chronic pain also have a major depressive 

disorder.    
""There is an incorrect impression among many doctors that if you treat a patient's depression, it will make their pain 

better. Not so,"" says Daniel J. Clauw, M.D., one of the authors of the paper. Clauw is director of the U-M Chronic Pain and 

 Fatigue  Research Center and professor of rheumatology at the U-M Medical School. ""If someone has pain and depression, you 

have to treat both.""    
The study involved 33 women and 20 men with fibromyalgia, a type of chronic pain that affects several million people, more 

often in women than in men, and typically involves tenderness to the touch, stiffness and fatigue. In addition to those 53 

patients, another 42 healthy companion participants were involved in the study.    
The testing included a measurement of pain experienced by subjects based on their tolerance of pressure applied to their left 

thumbnails using a hard rubber probe. Researchers also conducted interviews and had the subjects fill out questionnaires. 

Using functional  MRI  (fMRI) scans, researchers compared the subjects' magnitude of pain, experimental pain sensitivity and 

symptoms of depression. The study was conducted at the Georgetown University Medical Center before Clauw and several 

colleagues moved to U-M.    
Clauw and the other researchers found that in fibromyalgia patients, much less pressure was required to activate the neurons 

associated with acute pain in the brain's sensory domain than among the healthy controls.    
Clauw says that some other clinical research has supported the idea that pain and depression should be treated independently 

from one another. This, however, is the first time it has been shown using fMRI brain scans.    
""We have seen that if you give antidepressants to the average patient with fibromyalgia, they'll come back a couple of months 

later and say, 'My pain isn't any better, but I don't feel so sad about it,' "" Clauw says. ""Our research provides further 

evidence that these pathways are quite independent.""    
While this study looked at fibromyalgia patients, it is possible that the results may apply to people who have other chronic 

pain conditions, such as low-back pain,  irritable bowel syndrome  and  vulvodynia , the researchers say.    
The lead author of the study was Thorsten Giesecke, M.D., research fellow at the U-M Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research 

Center. In addition to Clauw and Giesecke, other others were Richard H. Gracely, Ph.D.; David A. Williams, Ph.D.; and Michael 

E. Geisser, Ph.D., all of the U-M Health System; and Frank W. Petzke, M.D., of the University of Cologne. Giesecke also is 

affiliated with the University of Cologne.    
The research was supported by the Department of the Army and the National Institutes of Health, including a grant from the 

General Clinical Research Center Program of the National Center for Research Resources.    
Clauw and his team at the U-M Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center also are working on studies of activity, exercise and 

pain among people with all kinds of chronic-pain conditions. They have started a registry of people who would be willing to 

take part in such studies, both those with chronic conditions and those without. For more information on the registry and the

If a teenager swaps sugary sodas and drinks for non-calorie drinks his/her chances of losing weight improve significantly.  According to a report in the journal Pediatrics, replacing these sugar-sweetened drinks can cut consumption of calorie-loaded soft drinks by up to four-fifths.    

In the study, non-calorie drinks were delivered to teenagers' homes for a period of six months.  There were 47 boys and 56 girls - all aged 13-18.  Half received non-calorie drinks while the other half received sugary drinks - the two groups were randomly selected.  They consumed, on average, one drink a day.    

Those receiving non-sugary drinks were also told not to consume sugary drinks when outside the home.  The other group were told to carry on as they normally would.
   
The researchers found that teenagers today consume half their soft drinks at home.    

They found that over the six month period, those receiving the non-calorie drinks had cut their sugary drinks consumption by 82%. The other group did not change.    

It was found that at the end of the six months, changes in body mass index ( BMI ) did not change significantly among people who were not very overweight at the start of the study.  However, those who started off with a BMI of over 25 did had a significant reduction in Body Mass Index.  In the group who were told not to change their habits, those who started off with a BMI over 25 actually got fatter.    

The results were not affected by such factors as gender, age, ethnicity, family income or race.  The amount of physical activity was not changed during the study period either.    



Cara Ebbeling, Ph.D., one of the authors of the study said the trial was small and over a short period.  Further, larger studies, over a longer period, would be needed.

But a new research abstract to be presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies 2016 Meeting suggests that certain family, social and community assets may boost a child's chances of flourishing in the face of adversity.

For the study, ""The Relative Contributions of Adverse Childhood Experiences and Healthy Environments to Child Flourishing,"" researchers analyzed data from the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, to gauge children's health and well-being, physical, emotional and behavioral health indicators, family context and neighborhood environment.

""We focused on questions about ACEs exposure, but also family, social and community assets that could serve to moderate that risk or enhance resilience,"" said lead author Iman Sharif, MD, MPH, chief of the division of general pediatrics at Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Del., and co-director of the Nemours Primary Care Research Collaborative. Her research team found that even when children were exposed to adverse childhood experiences, certain family and community strengths appeared to have a protective effect on health, social and behavioral outcomes. Among the most influential of these were having access to patient-centered, coordinated medical care, mothers who were in excellent mental health, and community supports. The latter was gauged by responses to statements such as, ""I have adults I can trust, people to count on.""

Additional protective factors identified in the study included fathers in excellent mental health, mothers and fathers who had completed at least some college, living in a neighborhood with amenities such as sidewalks, a library, a park and a recreation center, and mothers in good physical health.

""The research for the past 20 years has clearly demonstrated the relationship between ACEs exposure and adult physical and mental health outcomes. This study adds to the emerging literature on the impact of ACEs on child health outcomes, and goes further to identify the factors that can help children thrive even when exposed to ACEs,"" Dr. Sharif said.

The findings support earlier research showing that ACEs exposure does not render health systems and communities ""helpless,"" she said. ""This shows there are things we can do,"" she said. ""With appropriate screening to identify children at risk we can support children and families through the patient-centered medical home, linking parents to mental health services, and building community social supports to help children succeed.""

Dr. Sharif will present the abstract The Relative Contributions of Adverse Childhood Experiences and Healthy Environments to Child Flourishing. Only the abstract will be presented at the meeting. In some cases, the researcher may have more data available to share with media, or may be preparing a longer article for submission to a journal.

Vitamin D is key for the development and maintenance of healthy bones. It also has many positive effects on the immune system, endocrine glands, and cardiovascular system.  

Some observational studies have linked vitamin D deficiency with a higher risk of colorectal and breast cancer, while others have found a correlation between vitamin D levels and the risk of autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. 


A new study - carried out by researchers from the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom - investigates the effect of vitamin D levels on muscle strength. 


The findings were published in the journal PLOS One.

Using innovative technology, researchers were able to study both active and inactive vitamin D levels, together with their impact on muscle strength. 

Vitamin D - whether it is in D2 or D3 form - is, by itself, biologically inactive, until it is activated by two enzymatic reactions: one in the liver and the other in the kidney. 

Dr. Zaki Hassan-Smith, from the University of Birmingham, explains the novelty of the research procedure in the current study: 
""Previous studies have tested for the inactive forms of vitamin D in the bloodstream, to measure vitamin D deficiency. Here, we were able to develop a new method of assessing multiple forms of vitamin D, alongside extensive testing of body composition, muscle function, and muscle gene expression."" 
The team examined vitamin D levels in 116 healthy participants aged between 20 and 74. They also measured the participants' body fat and ""lean body mass"" - a measure of muscle mass, obtained by subtracting the body fat weight from the total body weight.  

The researchers found that women who had a healthy composition and lower levels of body fat were less prone to high levels of inactive vitamin D - a common marker of vitamin D deficiency. 

Conversely, women with more body fat tended to have less inactive vitamin D. 
While this does suggest a relationship between vitamin D and body composition, the active form of vitamin D did not correlate with body fat. Instead, vitamin D levels were linked with lean mass. 

People who had a higher lean mass and muscle mass also had higher levels of active vitamin D. This suggests that active vitamin D may help to optimize muscle strength. 

Dr. Hassan-Smith explains the findings, which echo previous studies that have suggested a link between a lack of muscle mass and low vitamin D levels: 
""By looking at multiple forms in the same study, we can say that it is a more complex relationship that previously thought. It may be that body fat is linked to increased levels of inactive vitamin D, but lean mass is the key for elevated levels of active vitamin D. It is vital to understand the complete picture, and the causal mechanisms at work, so we can learn how to supplement vitamin D intake to enhance muscle strength.""
The scientists also note that some of the beneficial associations were not found in men, and that future, larger-scale studies are needed to establish whether the differences noticed are purely biological. The researchers plan to work with international colleagues in order to study the mechanisms in laboratory studies and clinical trials.  
      
""We have a good understanding of how vitamin D helps bone strength, but we still need to learn more about how it works for muscles,"" Dr. Hassan-Smith explains. ""When you look at significant challenges facing healthcare providers across the world, such as obesity and an aging population, you can see how optimizing muscle function is of great interest.""

A new study shows that it is possible to reduce the level of sugar in muffins without affecting their textural properties by replacing half of the sugar content with stevianna or inulin, which are plant-based sweeteners. Also, after individuals consumed sugar-replaced muffins, their glycemic response - or the concentration of glucose in the blood - was lower than when they consumed regular muffins.

""We have applied our knowledge of food systems to investigate how food manufacturers can reduce the amount of added sugar in food products whilst still maintaining quality characteristics for the consumer,"" said Dr. Margaret Brennan, co-author of the International Journal of Food Science & Technology study. ""Careful selection and incorporation of low calorific natural sugar replacers into foods can lead to improved dietary intakes and control of glucose metabolism, body weight gain, and diet-related illnesses such as diabetes.""

In this study, ten severely obese teenage boys (average weight 367 lbs.; average age 17; 90 percent Caucasian), underwent vertical sleeve gastrectomy, a type of weight loss surgery which reduces the size of the stomach.

One year after surgery the teens had lost 111 pounds on average, and reduced their body mass index by 32 percent. Body mass index is a scientific way to evaluate body weight.

Levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL), the so-called good cholesterol, increased 23 percent in the year following surgery. In addition to measuring HDL levels, the researchers performed several tests to assess whether surgery had an impact on HDL function. Among their findings:
""Despite remaining obese, these young men showed improved metabolic health measured by HDL function after surgery,"" Shah said.

The preliminary study is limited by small numbers and having no female participants.

""We plan to expand our work to study girls, to look at time points sooner than one year to see how early after surgery HDL function improves, and will compare these results to other types of weight loss surgery,"" Shah said.

Depression and Anxiety are the most common causes of academic failure and social dysfunction in college students that remain underdiagnosed. With the use of a brief 4-question screener, these problems can easily be detected, says a new report from Ball State University.

The Psychometric Properties of PHQ-4 Depression and Anxiety Screening Scale Among College Students, assessed 934 college students and their psychosocial characteristics. Almost 10% students reported having depression and 20% reported having anxiety diagnosed by a healthcare professional within the past year. 

""There are thousands of college students and young adults across the nation silently suffering from depression and anxiety,"" said Jagdish Khubchandani, a community health education professor at Ball State. ""Among the many reasons for underdiagnoses of depression and anxiety in college students, a prominent reason is the lack of reliable, efficient, and time saving way to screen for these mental health issues"", he added. To address the problem, Khubchandani and colleagues developed a brief survey to diagnose anxiety and depression and tested the survey properties. The students were given a 4-item survey to predict depression (2 questions) or anxiety (2 questions).  The study, the first of its type, was published in the Archives of Psychiatric Nursing. 

According to various estimates, 15-25% American college students and young adults have diagnosable and treatable mental health issues. Among the mental health issues, depression and anxiety are the most common problems, frequently occur together, and start at an earlier age than other mental health issues. Depression is among the leading causes of disability in persons 15 years or older. It accounts for $30-50 billion in lost productivity and direct medical costs annually in the U.S.  ""Unfortunately, majority of the youth do not get timely treatment for mental health issues due to lack of diagnosis and even if they get treatment, it is inadequate or not disorder specific"". Khubchandani mentioned.

The study also found:

While the data show that the demand for college counseling services has increased nationwide, a lot has to be done to reach out to the tens of thousands of students who suffer from anxiety and depression and lack a regular source of care and treatment. ""A major problem is diagnosis and screening. The existing tools for diagnosis of depression and anxiety are elaborate and time consuming which prevents their use on population basis"" Khubchandani said. 

Khubchandani pointed out that underdiagnosed or undiagnosed students have a greater risk of engaging in risk behaviors, social dysfunction, and academic failure. ""Our 4-item survey is a valid, reliable, and efficient way to diagnose students with depression and anxiety. Timely detection can help adequate treatment and prevent future risk of health and social problems,"" he said. ""Our study is very timely as the US Department of Health and Human Services has released a national recommendation in February 2016 recommending routine screening for depression in adolescents and young adults. However, healthcare professionals have often cited lack of effective screening tools as a reason for avoiding routine screening for depression and anxiety in youth. Our brief 4 question screening tool could certainly help fill that gap.""  

""Future research should focus on the various ways through which college campuses can use our four-item survey to detect anxiety and depression in their student population,"" Khubchandani said. ""A wide spread implementation of our survey to detect anxiety and depression would require campus partnerships across various divisions of universities nationwide such as academic affairs, health education centers, clinics and counseling centers. Faculty and students can certainly play a central role in increasing awareness and assisting those who need help.""

New research indicates that household food insecurity dramatically increases the likelihood of metabolic diseases in children, with many showing chronic disease markers before they graduate from high school. The study published in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association.

Food insecurity, defined as lacking access to food for an active, healthy life, is a preventable health threat. Yet, lack of basic access to food affects 14.3 percent of all U.S. households and 19.5 percent of households with children.

""This is a looming health issue for the nation. The number of households with severely low levels of food security among children almost doubled between 2003 to 2010,"" said lead researcher David Holben, PhD, professor and department chair of nutrition and hospitality management at the University of Mississippi.

To study the potential effects of food insecurity, Dr. Holben and colleagues from the University of Mississippi and Ohio State University administered the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey to a cross-sectional sample of adolescents ages 12 to 18. More than 7,500 participants were interviewed in their homes and given physical examinations between 1999 and 2006.

The data revealed that participants from households with marginally low, low and very low food security were 33 to 44 percent more likely than their high food secure counterparts to be overweight.

Children with very low to marginal food security were also 1.5 times more likely to meet the criteria for central obesity, defined as having excessive fat around the stomach and abdomen. Central obesity is linked to heart disease and metabolic disorders such as diabetes.

""These families often have to make the difficult decision of choosing to buy healthy food or buying food they can afford,"" said co-author Christopher Taylor, PhD, associate professor of medical dietetics and family medicine at Ohio State University. ""Physicians can help their patients identify resources such as local food banks or the Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to help bridge that gap.""

Dr. Ulrick Vieux, DO, MS, an American Osteopathic Association health policy fellow and psychiatry residency program director at Orange Regional Medical Center in Middletown, N.Y., explains that improving access to adequate, nutrient-based food starts at school, where children can potentially have access to all three meals which they might not have at home.

""Many children rely on school meals to provide healthier meals that they may not be exposed to at home or the community."" said Dr. Vieux. ""Policies such as the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 set nutrition standards and increase access to such meals. It's important that we advocate for policies like this to ensure our nation's children are getting the nutrition they need to minimize future obesity-related complications.""

Patients with  depression  treated in two independent health care systems 
experienced overall drops in suicide attempts between the month prior to starting treatment with 
 antidepressant  medications and the month after treatment began.    

The findings are based on records from a large prepaid health plan and from Veterans Health 
Administration databases, reflecting the clinical care of more than 330,000 patients. These two 
studies are reported in the July issue of the  American Journal of Psychiatry (AJP) , the official 
journal of the American Psychiatric Association.    

The first study, ""Suicide Attempts Among Patients Starting Depression Treatment with 
Medications or Psychotherapy,"" is presented by Gregory Simon, M.D., M.P.H., and James 
Savarino, Ph.D., of Group Health Cooperative-a mixed-model prepaid health plan with 
approximately 500,000 members in Washington State and Idaho.    

Among the 109,256 members treated for depression between 1996 and 2005, suicide attempts 
decreased during the first month of treatment and diminished further in subsequent months. This 
progressive decline occurred for both patients taking medication and those receiving 
psychotherapy. About 60 percent of the treatment episodes began with antidepressant 
prescriptions and about 40 percent began with psychotherapy visits.    

The second study, involving veterans, is described in ""The Relationship Between Antidepressants 
and Suicide: Results of Analysis of the Veterans Health Administration Datasets,"" by Robert 
Gibbons, Ph.D., Kwan Hur, Ph.D., J. John Mann, M.D., and colleagues at the University of 
Illinois at Chicago and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. The findings are based on 
226,866 veterans diagnosed with depression during 2003-2004. The analysis, in addition to 
showing a decrease in suicide attempts once treatment began, also revealed a lower rate of suicide 
attempts in depressed veterans who took antidepressants compared to those who did not.    

Selective  serotonin  reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were the most commonly prescribed 
antidepressants, and the rate of suicide attempts for patients taking SSRIs fell from 221 per 
100,000 patients before treatment, to 123 per 100,000 after treatment began. The rate also fell 
after the beginning of treatment with medications known as non-serotonergic and tricyclic 
antidepressants.    

The positive overall outcomes in the two studies were shared by the youngest patients. The 
adolescents and young adults studied by Simon and Savarino made approximately twice as many 
suicide attempts as the total group, but they showed a similar decline after beginning treatment.    
Gibbons et al. found that all age groups, including 18 to 25 year olds, experienced both a decline 

 

in suicide attempts with treatment and a lower incidence among depressed veterans receiving 
SSRIs, compared to those receiving no antidepressant treatment.    

The authors point out that large-scale studies do not exclude the possibility that depression 
treatment may precipitate suicidal thinking or behavior in vulnerable individuals.    

The findings are reviewed in an editorial by David Brent, M.D., of the University of Pittsburgh.    
 AJP  Editor in Chief Robert Freedman, M.D., stated ""These studies of treatment in actual clinical 
practice find a decrease in suicide attempts after treatment, regardless of whether the treatment is 
psychotherapy or drug therapy. Patients and their doctors are concerned because of the FDA's 
black-box warning that antidepressants can cause suicide attempts. The studies in this issue 
provide more evidence that this side effect is rare, compared to the overall decrease in suicide 
attempts that occurs when treatment is initiated. Furthermore, suicide attempts in the first month 
of treatment occur regardless of whether the treatment is psychotherapy or drug therapy, which 
suggests that these attempts are part of the natural evolution of symptoms in depression itself.""    

Both studies were funded by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health. Additional 
financial disclosures appear at the end of the article.

There are currently numerous campaigns trying to raise awareness of the negative health effects of sugar, particularly on weight gain and obesity. 

Sugar is highly pervasive in our diet. Approximately 75 percent of processed foods and drinks contain added sugar. 

Additionally, the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) has increased fivefold since the 1950s. 

Numerous studies have pointed to a link between SSBs and cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. 

The alternative to SSBs promoted by soft drink companies is the sugar-free, ""diet"" drink. These artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs) are said to be healthful and prevent weight gain. 

But researchers from Imperial College London in the United Kingdom argue otherwise.  

A new commentary on existing ASB research and policy - published in the journal PLOS Medicine - argues that ASBs are just as ineffective in preventing weight loss as their full-sugar counterparts. 

The commentary is a collaborative effort between Imperial College London, University of Sao Paulo and the Federal University of Pelotas - both in Brazil - and Washington University in St. Louis, MO.   

According to the authors, in the U.K., SSBs make up a third of the total sugar intake among teenagers. In Brazil, they are the second largest source of dietary sugar, and in the United States, SSBs account for almost half of the added sugar in Americans' diet. 

The researchers - led by Prof. Christopher Millett - argue that although SSBs are very high in calories, they contain almost no essential nutrients. Additionally, ""convincing epidemiological evidence"" has suggested that consuming SSBs increases the risk of being overweight or obese, as well as developing diabetes. 

ASBs are becoming more and more popular as an alternative to harmful sugary drinks. By 2008, the number of American children consuming ASBs had doubled, compared with 1999.

Soft drinks, fruit juices, flavored water, and ready-to-drink coffee and tea are all artificially sweetened. 
Because they taste similar to their full-sugar counterparts and have none of their energy content, ASBs are perceived as healthful, as it is believed they do not trigger any energy compensation mechanisms. 

Additionally, ""taxes and regulation on SBS and not ASBs will ultimately promote the consumption of diet drinks rather than plain water - the desirable source of hydration for everyone,"" mentions Prof. Carlos Monteiro, one of the authors of the review. 


However, researchers explain why the common perception of diet drinks might be wrong.ASBs can still cause a compensatory mechanism by stimulating sweet taste receptors. This can, in turn,  increase appetite and stimulate the secretion of gut hormones. Knowing that ASBs are low in calories might amplify these effects and lead to excessive consumption of other foods. 

This chain reaction could lead to weight gain, obesity, and obesity-related complications. 

In fact, Millett and team point out that several observational studies and meta-analyses have correlated ASBs with increased body mass index (BMI) and a higher risk of cardiometabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and stroke.  

However, observational studies are vulnerable to so-called reverse causality - for example, people with obesity might tend to consume more ASBs because they are trying to control their weight, rather than the ASBs causing the weight gain themselves. 

Even so, randomized controlled trials of ASBs have shown either no effect at all on weight loss, or only minor reductions in weight.

The authors warn against the dangers of biased research and conflicting interests. They refer to a systematic review that has shown studies sponsored by beverage companies tend to report positive effects of ASB on weight management. 

""The lack of solid evidence on the health effects of ASBs and the potential influence of bias from industry-funded studies should be taken seriously when discussing whether ASBs are adequate alternatives to SSBs,"" says Dr. Maria Carolina Borges, first author of the new review.

Finally, while the evidence reviewed does not directly demonstrate that ASBs trigger weight gain or metabolic disorders, it does not show ASBs to be effective for weight loss either. 

The authors conclude: 

""The absence of evidence to support the role of ASBs in preventing weight gain and the lack of studies on other long-term effects on health strengthen the position that ASBs should not be promoted as part of a healthy diet. 

Far from helping to solve the global obesity crisis, characteristics related to ASB composition [...], consumption patterns [...], and environmental impact make them a potential risk factor for highly prevalent chronic diseases.""

Whether or not a woman is obese will likely affect her outcome once she has been diagnosed with  ovarian cancer , according to a new study from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
   
The study, published online on Aug. 28 in the American Cancer Society's journal Cancer, showed that  obesity  affected survival rates, shortened the length of time to recurrence of the disease, and led to earlier death from the  cancer  than for women diagnosed at their  ideal body weight .
   
""This study is the first to identify weight as an independent factor in ovarian cancer in disease progression and overall survival, suggesting that there is an element in the fat tissue itself that influences the outcome of this disease in obese women,"" said Andrew Li, M.D., the study's principal investigator at Cedars-Sinai's Women's Cancer Research Institute at the Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute.
   
Ovarian cancer, one of the most lethal cancers, affects almost one in 60 women. Most will be diagnosed with advanced disease, and 70 percent will die within five years. There are several types of ovarian cancer, but tumors that begin with the surface cells of the ovary (epithelial cells) are the most common type. While previous studies have shown that obesity is a factor in the development and prognosis of cancers such as breast, uterine and colorectal, the nature of the relationship in ovarian cancers has been less well understood. Obesity is defined as a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 30 or above.
   
In this study, Li and his colleagues examined data from 216 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer to identify relationships between obesity, ovarian cancer,  tumor  biology and outcome. Comparison of the obese women (35 of 216) to ideal-weight women (108 of 216) showed 29 percent of the obese women and 10 percent of normal-weight women had localized disease. However, obesity was shown to have a significant effect on both the recurrence and mortality of women with advanced disease. The cellular characteristics of the tumors found in the two groups also appeared to be different.
   
""While further molecular studies are warranted, our study suggests that fat tissue excretes a hormone or protein that causes ovarian cancer cells to grow more aggressively,"" said Li, who is also a physician in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. ""The next steps will be to examine this relationship more closely, and to determine the exact biological mechanisms that influence tumor growth in ovarian cancer.""
   
Obesity, which affects more than 30 percent of adults 20 years or older in the United States -- more than 60 million people, according to a 2004 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association -- is a growing health concern. Recently linked to many types of cancer, obesity has already been linked to several serious medical conditions, including  heart disease ,  diabetes  and  asthma . Studies have shown that a person who is 40 percent overweight is twice as likely to die prematurely compared to an average-weight person.
   
""The Women's Cancer Research Institute (WCRI) is dedicated to eradicating cancer as a threat to women in the United States and throughout the world,"" said Beth Karlan, M.D., director of the WCRI and a co-author on the study. ""Studies such as this one increase our understanding of the disease and move us closer toward this goal.""

The sticky residue left behind by tobacco smoke can do worse damage than stinking up furniture and discoloring walls. Exposure to thirdhand smoke leads to biological effects on weight and cell development that could be damaging to one's health, according to new research led by scientists at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab).

The researchers found that newborn mice housed with smoke-treated cloths for three weeks weighed significantly less than mice in a control group. Moreover, newborn and adult mice exposed to thirdhand smoke led to persistent changes in blood cell counts associated with the immune system for both newborn and adult mice. The blood cell count changes are associated with inflammatory and allergic reactions upon exposure to thirdhand smoke, the researchers said.

Berkeley Lab researchers from the Biological Systems and Engineering Division and the Energy Technologies Area (ETA) teamed up with scientists at UC San Francisco and Nanjing Medical University for the study. The findings, to be reported in Scientific Reports, suggest that the dangers associated with smoking continue long after the cigarette is snuffed out.

""We suspected that the young are most vulnerable because of their immature immune systems, but we didn't have a lot of hard evidence to show that before,"" said study lead author Bo Hang, a Berkeley Lab staff scientist who previously found that thirdhand smoke could lead to genetic mutations in human cells. ""In this case, we found that thirdhand smoke appeared to inhibit weight gain in neonatal mice, but not in the young adults.""

Notably, the weight effect was temporary. Weeks after smoke exposure stopped, the mice began catching up with their non-exposed peers in weight.

The researchers noted that human babies and toddlers are at greater risk because they come into contact with contaminated surfaces while crawling or teething during a critical window of immune system development.

While the harmful effects of active and secondhand smoking have been well-established by decades of extensive studies, research into thirdhand smoke is still in its nascent stages. But evidence is mounting that the residue lingering on indoor surfaces could be just as harmful - if not more - than secondhand smoke.

Some of the key studies in this area have come from Berkeley Lab with support from the Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program (TRDRP) through the California Consortium on Thirdhand Smoke. The program is funded by state cigarette taxes and managed by the University of California.

Red flags were raised in 2010 when Berkeley Lab research led by Hugo Destaillats, Mohamad Sleiman, and Lara Gundel in ETA's Indoor Environment Group found that nicotine can react with ozone and nitrous acid in the air to create ultrafine organic aerosols and cancer-causing compounds. Subsequent studies led by Hang, Jian-Hua Mao, and Altaf Sarker at Berkeley Lab found that thirdhand smoke led to genetic instability in human and mouse cell lines and in mouse models.

Destaillats, Gundel, Hang and Mao are all co-authors on this new study, which goes further by characterizing the biological effects of exposure to thirdhand smoke, an environment created by placing 5-square-centimeter pieces of smoke-contaminated cotton cloth in the cages with the mice. The researchers focused on changes to body weight and the hematopoietic system after three weeks of exposure for two age groups of mice: birth to 3 weeks (neonatal) and 12-15 weeks (young adult). They were compared to a control group of mice that were not exposed to smoke.

While the effects on weight were only seen in the neonatal mice, changes in blood cell populations were evident in both age groups. In general, there were lower levels of platelets and specific types of white blood cells in the smoke-exposed mice. For example, neonatal mice exposed to thirdhand smoke had higher levels of eosinophils, female adults had higher levels of neutrophils, male adults had higher levels of basophils, and all mice had higher levels of B cells.

""Those are all types of white blood cells associated with inflammation and allergic reactions,"" said Mao, the current study's corresponding author. ""And the effects on blood cell count persisted even after exposure ended. Changes remained at least 14 weeks after exposure ended for the neonatal group, and two weeks after it ended for the adults.""

The researchers pointed out that they did not study whether the observed biological changes led to specific diseases or other health outcomes, but that other studies suggest links to adverse health effects.

""Thirdhand smoke is an underappreciated risk factor in health,"" said study co-author Antoine Snijders. ""It's clear that more and bigger studies are needed, particularly in humans, so we can support policy decisions on thirdhand smoke.""

Berkeley Lab research on DNA damage by thirdhand smoke was among the evidence cited by California legislators when they passed a bill in 2014 banning smoking in private homes used as day care centers.

High school students going to bed between 10 and 11 p.m. on weekdays get better grades. 

There is a strong relationship between sleep problems and poor academic performances among adolescents, a new study demonstrates. 

The study is published in Journal of Sleep Research, and show that the less the adolescent sleep - the worse the grades get on average.

Our findings suggests that going to bed earlier, and encouraging similar bed- and sleeping times during the week, are important for academic performance, says psychology specialist and first author Mari Hysing at Uni Research in Bergen, Norway.

Hysing and colleagues analysed data from a large population based study conducted in Norway in 2012, including 7798 adolescents from Hordaland county. This survey is called youth@hordaland - a large and representative sample. 

School performance was measured by Grade point average (GPA), and obtained from official administrative registries. The adolescents (aged 16-19) who went to bed between 10 and 11 p.m. had the best grades on average.  

Going to bed much later during weekends than weekdays, were also associated with lower GPA. 

The new study is a collaboration between researchers from Uni Research, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Ørebro University and University of California, Berkeley.

The results underscore the importance of sleep for academic functioning, the researchers point out:

Academic performance is an important marker for future work affiliation and health. Future studies should investigate further how the association between sleep and school impacts upon future educational status and work affiliation, they write.

After adjusting for sociodemographic information, short sleep duration and sleep deficit were the sleep measures with highest odds of poor performance at school.

Hysing and colleagues only investigated the association between sleep and school performance. When adjusting for non-attendance in school, associations were somewhat reduced, but the link between sleep and GPA was still significant.",0

A new Tel Aviv University study finds that a popular food supplement called phosphatidylserine may be instrumental in reversing the detrimental effects of Familial Dysautonomia (FD), a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that affects approximately 1 in 31 Jewish people of Eastern European, or Ashkenazi, ancestry. FD affects aspects of the autonomic nervous system such as swallowing, sweating, and pain sensitivity, and places patients at increased risk for pulmonary and gastrointestinal complications.

The research, led jointly by Prof. Gil Ast and Prof. Eran Perlson of TAU's Sackler School of Medicine, generated a mouse model of FD to examine the neuron degeneration caused by FD and to observe the positive effects of the novel therapy. The study was published in PLOS Genetics.

""Neurons are the longest cells in our body,"" said Prof. Ast. ""'Highways' along our neurons allow 'trucks' with 'cargo' to supply our neurons with essential supplies. In most neurodegenerative diseases these highways - called microtubules - and the axonal transport process are impaired. Our study demonstrates that alterations in the stability of microtubules and disruptions in the transport may lead to FD.""

The research team, including Shiran Naftelberg-Blonder and other TAU students, generated a mouse model of FD. The mice exhibited symptoms similar to those experienced by human patients with FD, including developmental delays, sensory abnormalities, unstable microtubules, and impairment of axonal retrograde transport of nerve growth factor.

""We found that in neurons from our FD mice, the microtubular highways were impaired by elevated levels of an enzyme called HDAC6,"" said Prof. Ast. ""This impairment removed the adhesive that connects the 'bricks' of the highway. This led to less stabilized highways and to the slower movement of cargo along it.""

Once the mouse exhibiting FD symptoms was generated, the researchers administered a phosphatidylserine treatment, which lowered the level of the enzyme that removed the ""glue"" from the ""bricks"" of the microtubular highways. Phosphatidylserine contains both amino acids and fatty acids and is known to be effective in slowing down long-term memory loss.

The researchers found that the treatment with phosphatidylserine enhanced the stability of the microtubular ""highways"" and improved the movement of ""cargo"" along these pathways. ""We identified the molecular pathway that leads to neurodegeneration in FD and demonstrated that phosphatidylserine has the potential to slow progression of neurodegeneration,"" said Prof. Ast.

""Phosphatidylserine can repair the activity in neurons from the FD mouse by reducing the amount of the enzyme that removes the 'glue' from the 'bricks,'"" Prof. Ast continued. ""This elevates the stability of the 'highways' and increases essential cargo movement along these neurological pathways.""

The researchers are currently researching ways of improving the delivery of phosphatidylserine to the nervous system. Teva Pharmaceuticals contributed support for this research through the National Network of Excellence.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), asthma is one of the most common long-term health conditions among children, affecting 6.8 million, or 9.3% of the under-18 population. It also affects 8% of American adults, or 18.7 million people, and tends to be hereditary.

A person who has asthma always has it, but an attack, or exacerbation, will only occur when something irritates the lungs. Symptoms include wheezing and difficulty breathing, tightness in the chest and coughing at night or early in the morning.

The CDC note that the causes of asthma have not been established; nor is there a cure.

Asthma exacerbations lead to millions of days of absenteeism from work or school, as well as hospitalizations. Spending on direct health care totals $50 billion annually in the US.

Previous attempts to determine the causes of an attack have involved swabbing individual patients to detect viruses. Scientists have suggested that air quality in schools or other environmental factors might be to blame. 
In the current study, Lauren Meyers, professor of integrative biology and statistics and data sciences at the University of Texas-Austin, and colleagues built a computer model to investigate the impact of the common cold virus on asthma. The model incorporated potential triggers of asthma attacks. 

The team also examined population data for cities across Texas over a 7-year period. The data showed the circulation of the common cold virus among adults and children throughout the year and the timing and locations of approximately 66,000 hospitalizations for asthma.

They tested each driver separately and compared the output of the model to the real-world health data. This enabled them to determine the relative impact of each trigger and to discover which combination of factors best matched the data.

Results revealed that the primary driver of asthma exacerbations was the spread of cold viruses, a factor that is largely influenced by the school calendar. Among children, daily viral prevalence was the strongest predictor of asthma hospitalizations. During school holidays, transmission was 45% lower.

For adults, there was a wider range of hospitalization patterns, but there were peaks in the winter, apparently driven by influenza.

The study did not suggest a significant role for ozone or particulate matter, such as dust, possibly because of the geographical spread of the population.

The authors speculate that during school breaks, children tend to interact less with other children and are exposed to fewer viruses, leading to a drop in their viral immunity. On returning to school, viral exposure is much higher, and this is just at the time when children are most vulnerable.

The team developed more accurate rates of transmission of cold viruses than previous studies. This could help to improve understanding of how common colds spread and to inform strategies to protect those who are most at risk.

Meyers points out that the school calendar predicts common cold transmission, which in turn predicts the prevalence of asthma attacks.

She suggests: 
""This work can improve public health strategies to keep asthmatic children healthy. For example, at the riskiest times of year, doctors could encourage patient adherence to preventative medications, and schools could take measures to reduce cold transmission.""
Medical News Today reported recently that scientists have discovered the immune cells that fight the cold virus in the lungs.

A new toothpaste ingredient which puts back the lost minerals from tooth enamel and helps prevent decay and treat sensitivity while you sleep is available online and from specialist dental distributors now. It is expected to be available through high street stores by the end of the year.

The new BioMinF toothpaste ingredient provides a new tooth repair technology which will bring relief to the millions of adults and children around the world who are prone to tooth decay and sensitivity.

Dental decay is the most prevalent disease worldwide and the majority of adults will also experience tooth sensitivity at some stage during their lives. Decay is the single biggest reason for children being admitted into hospital with between 60-90 percent of school children being affected.

Tooth decay and sensitivity is estimated to affect 13.5million people in the UK alone.

Toothpastes containing BioMInF are able to slowly release calcium, phosphate and fluoride ions over an 8-12 hour timeframe to form fluorapatite mineral to rebuild, strengthen and protect tooth structure. The slow release of fluoride has been identified to be particularly beneficial in prevention of tooth decay.

""Using remineralising toothpaste makes teeth far more resistant to attack from acidic soft drinks like fruit juices and sodas. It is also much more effective than conventional toothpastes where the active ingredients, such as soluble fluoride, are washed away and become ineffective less than two hours after brushing,"" said Professor Robert Hill, Chair of Dental Physical Sciences at Queen Mary, University of London, who led the team which developed BioMin and won the 2013 Armourers and Brasiers Venture Prize.

""This breakthrough innovation could significantly reduce dental decay and also tooth sensitivity problems which are often experienced by people eating or drinking something cold,"" said Professor Hill.

""The technology behind BioMin is not however exclusively designed for toothpastes,"" added Professor Hill. ""It can also be incorporated in other professionally applied dental products such as cleaning and polishing pastes, varnishes and remineralising filling materials.""

Professor Hill has co-founded, BioMin Technologies, which aims to commercialise the development. The company will be led by chief executive Richard Whatley who has 30 years international management experience within the dental industry working for market leading companies such as Dentsply and KaVo.

""We are very excited by the prospects of developing the patented technology which has been licensed from Queen Mary University of London and Imperial College,"" said CEO Richard Whatley."" We are in the process of establishing licencing agreements with toothpaste and dental materials manufacturers around the world.

""A key element of our business model includes business partners also becoming investor stakeholders in the company thus reducing the need for traditional third party financing from venture capitalists. Our aim is for the BioMin brand to become synonymous for the treatment of tooth sensitivity in the eyes of both the dental profession and the general public.""

Dr David Gillam, with expertise in the management of dentine hypersensitivity and a consultant and co-founder of BioMin said,"" Tooth sensitivity is caused by open tubules in the teeth allowing access to the nerve receptors which may affect the quality of life of individuals particularly when eating and drinking hot and cold food and drink. BioMin containing toothpastes are effective by sealing the tubules with acid resistant fluorapatite which act as a barrier to hot and cold being transmitted inside the tooth.""

A fluoride free version of BioMin is also being developed for individuals who do not want or need fluoride toothpaste.

Advancements in critical care make it possible for even the sickest children to successfully undergo liver transplantation. According to a new study published online in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons (JACS), children who are sick enough to require mechanical ventilation or dialysis before transplantation achieve the same survival benefit as children who are stable prior to the surgical procedure. The study will appear in a print edition of the Journal this spring.

Since pediatric critical care was recognized as a specialty area of medicine in the 1980s-1990s, survival and disease recovery rates for acutely ill children have improved significantly. Pediatric intensive care units have reduced mortality rates for children with such life-threatening conditions as sepsis, cardiac arrest, and traumatic brain injury. Postoperative critical care systems have improved outcomes after many types of organ transplantation. These advances have increased survival of children with acute liver failure without transplantation and stabilized children with chronic liver failure who are on the wait list for transplantation.

In the present study, surgeons from Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, found that pediatric critical care also has led to steady improvements in survival after liver transplantation regardless of the severity of illness of a child.

""Our study suggests that successful outcomes are now possible in the most critically ill patients with liver failure. Every effort should be made to transplant more children and sicker children,"" said John A. Goss, MD, FACS, professor of surgery, Michael E. DeBakey Department of Surgery and chief of the division of abdominal transplantation at Baylor.

The study is a nationwide evaluation of all children under the age of 18 years who had liver transplantation between 1987 and 2015. Although transplantations were performed in the 1960s, the study began gathering data from 1987 when the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) first established measures for evaluating transplantation outcomes. The study divided data into two segments to compare outcomes of patients treated before and after 2002, when the Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease system (PELD) was instituted. PELD is a method of scoring severity of liver disease on the basis of age, failure to grow, serum indicators of liver function, and an international normalized ratio. A similar set of data was gathered to reflect outcomes for children treated at Texas Children's Hospital.

Over the course of the study period, 13,723 children underwent liver transplantation across the country and were followed for an average of 6.6 years. A total of 4,248 of these children were in the ICU at the time of transplantation; these patients were followed for an average of 5.7 years. Between 2002 and 2015, 6,746 children had liver transplantation, 1,816 of whom were in the ICU at the time of the surgery.

Survival improved steadily for all patients over time. One-year survival was 66 percent in 1987 and 92 percent in 2015. Survival likewise improved for the sickest patients, as defined by the need for dialysis or mechanical ventilation. The one-year survival rate for patients on dialysis was 50 percent in 1995 and 95 percent in 2013; survival for patients on a ventilator was 49 percent in 1994 and 94 percent in 2013. The same survival benefit was seen in infants; the one-year survival rate increased from 45 percent in 1988 to 88 percent in 2013.

At Texas Children's Hospital, 65 of the 354 patients who had liver transplantation between 2002 and 2015 were ill enough to require admission to the ICU at the time of the operation. Survival at one year was 92 percent for the entire group and 87 percent for ICU patients.

An analysis of clinical and institutional risk factors that may affect survival showed that medical centers performing fewer than five transplants per year had poorer outcomes than high-volume centers.

""As critical care has improved and medical centers can keep seriously ill children alive longer, the question has evolved from can we perform a transplantation to should we do a transplant operation. The answer is yes, we can go ahead and transplant an organ into a critically ill child and expect the same outcome we would see in a stable child. The one caveat is if a medical center does not have the resources to perform a high volume of transplantations, then it should transfer critically ill children to a center that does,"" Dr. Goss said.

The study was supported by the Cade R. Alpard Foundation. It was presented at the Southern Surgical Association 128th Annual Meeting, Palm Beach, FL, December 2016.

A cream which has been shown to trigger the skin to produce a tan without direct exposure to sunlight has been developed by scientists at the  Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital Boston, USA.  Studies on genetically engineered, fair-skinned, red-haired mice, were successful.   

You can read about this experiment in the journal  Nature .   

The mice were genetically engineered to have a disorder called xeroderma pigmentosum, their skin behaves in a similar way to skin of fair-skinned and/or red-haired people who do not tan, but burn when exposed to  UV radiation (sunlight).  The cells in their skin can't repair DNA damage caused by radiation.   

The cream makes the skin behave as if it were hit by the sun's ultraviolet light.  Fair-skinned people, as well as people with red hair, do not tan properly.  They have a MC1R defect, a receptor which when triggered produces pigmentation.  This defect means lower production of cAMP, a chemical which stimulates the melanocytes to produce pigmentation.  In simple terms, this means that these people do not tan - they burn when exposed to sunlight.  Many people with this rare genetic disorder have to stay in indoors while the sun is shining.   

The more your skin is burned when exposed to sunlight the higher your chances are of developing  skin cancer .   

The scientists applied a cream, which contained Forskolin, a chemical from the Forskohli plant, a tropical  mint  plant from India, to the skin of the mice.  Forskolin is known to raise cAMP levels.  The mice's skin got darker as a result - they developed a tan.  The scientists found that the tan looked virtually identical to the tan achieved from exposure to the sun.   

If human skin reacts in the same way to this cream, it will mean that fair-skinned and/or red haired people can be triggered to produce the same pigmentation.   

Apart from developing a sunless sun tan, the cream also seems to protect the skin better from exposure to UV light, meaning better protection from skin cancer.   

Whether or not this cream can benefit humans in the same way as the genetically-engineered mice remains to be seen.  Human skin is much thicker than the skin of mice.  The cream needs to penetrate deeply enough to trigger the production of pigments.   

Dr David Fisher, team leader,  said ""These studies suggest that a drug-induced  rescue  of the tanning mechanism may correspondingly rescue at least some aspect of skin cancer protection.  Such sunless tanning may also dissuade sun-seeking behaviours, which undoubtedly contribute significantly to high skin cancer incidence.""

Approximately 60 percent of young people habitually skip breakfast up to four times a week, previous research has shown. Although health experts recommend breakfast as a strategy to reduce an individual's chance of obesity, little research has examined if the actual type of breakfast consumed plays a significant role in one's health and weight management. University of Missouri researchers compared the benefits of consuming a normal-protein breakfast to a high-protein breakfast and found the high-protein breakfast - which contained 35 grams of protein - prevented gains of body fat, reduced daily food intake and feelings of hunger, and stabilized glucose levels among overweight teens who would normally skip breakfast.

Heather Leidy, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition and Exercise Physiology at the MU School of Medicine and lead author of the study, says the key to eating 35 grams of protein is to consume a combination of high-quality proteins including milk, eggs, lean meats and Greek yogurt.

""This study examined if the type of breakfast consumed can improve weight management in young people who habitually skip breakfast,"" said Leidy. ""Generally, people establish eating behaviors during their teen years. If teens are able to develop good eating habits now, such as eating breakfast, it's likely to continue the rest of their lives.""

Leidy and her colleagues fed two groups of overweight teens who reported skipping breakfast between five and seven times a week either normal-protein breakfast meals or high-protein breakfast meals. A third group of teens continued to skip breakfast for 12 weeks.

""The group of teens who ate high-protein breakfasts reduced their daily food intake by 400 calories and lost body fat mass, while the groups who ate normal-protein breakfast or continued to skip breakfast gained additional body fat,"" Leidy said. ""These results show that when individuals eat a high-protein breakfast, they voluntarily consume less food the rest of the day. In addition, teens who ate high-protein breakfast had more stable glucose levels than the other groups.""

Leidy says large fluctuations in glucose levels are associated with an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes among young people, which can make health complications associated with weight gain more intense.

The normal-protein breakfast meal was milk and cereal and contained 13 grams of protein. The high-protein breakfast meals included eggs, dairy and lean pork that contained 35 grams of protein. Participants in the groups were instructed to report feelings of hunger and their daily intakes of food and beverages. Their body weight and body composition were measured at the beginning and end of the 12-week period. In addition, the participants wore a device that assessed minute-to-minute glucose levels throughout the day.

Overweight and obesity in adolescents have increased substantially in recent decades, and currently affect a third of the adolescent population in some developed countries. This is an important public health concern because obesity early in life is considered to be a risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease and from all causes in adulthood.

Some studies suggest that an elevated body-mass index is associated with an increased risk of death from cardiovascular causes. However, a determination of the BMI threshold that is associated with increased risk of fatality remains uncertain. (BMI is a calculation of a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters, to quantify body mass and enable categorization as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.)

In light of the worldwide increase in childhood obesity, Prof. Jeremy Kark from the Hebrew University-Hadassah Braun School of Public Health and Community Medicine, in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Faculty of Medicine, together with Dr. Gilad Twig of the Sheba Medical Center, and Dr. Hagai Levine of the Braun School and other colleagues in Israel, set out to determine the association between body-mass index (BMI) in late adolescence and death from cardiovascular causes in adulthood.

Their study, which appears in the New England Journal of Medicine , was based on a national database of 2.3 million Israeli 17 year olds in whom height and weight were measured between 1967 and 2010. The researchers assessed the association between BMI in late adolescence and death from coronary heart disease, stroke, and sudden death in adulthood by mid-2011.

During 42,297,007 person-years of follow-up, 2918 of 32,127 deaths (9.1%) were from cardiovascular causes, including 1497 from coronary heart disease, 528 from stroke, and 893 from sudden death.

The results showed an increase in the risk of cardiovascular death in the group that was considered within the ""accepted normal"" range of BMI, in the 50th to 74th percentiles, and of death from coronary heart disease at BMI values above 20. The researchers concluded that even BMI considered ""normal"" during adolescence was associated with a graded increase in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality during the 40 years of follow-up. This included increased rates of death from coronary heart disease, stroke, and total cardiovascular causes among participants.

As BMI scores increased into the 75th to 84th percentiles, adolescent obesity was associated with elevated risk of death from coronary heart disease, stroke, sudden death from unknown causes, and death from total cardiovascular causes, as well as death from non-cardiovascular causes and death from all causes. Participants also had an increased risk of sudden death.

The rates of death per person-year were generally lowest in the group that had BMI values during adolescence in the 25th to 49th percentiles, although higher rates were observed among those below the 5th percentile.

How might adolescent BMI influence cardiovascular outcomes in adulthood? The researchers considered two possible pathways. First, obesity may be harmful during adolescence, since it has been associated with unfavorable metabolic abnormalities through risk factors such as unfavorable plasma lipid or lipoprotein levels, increased blood pressure, impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and formation of coronary and aortic atherosclerotic plaques. Furthermore, the timing of exposure to obesity during a person's lifetime may play an important role. Second, BMI tends to ""track' along the life course so that overweight adolescents tend to become overweight or obese adults, and overweight or obesity in adulthood affects the risk of cardiovascular disease.

""Our findings appear to provide a link between the trends in adolescent overweight during the past decades and coronary mortality in midlife,"" said the paper's senior author, Prof. Jeremy Kark of the Hebrew University-Hadassah Braun School of Public Health and Community Medicine. ""The continuing increase in adolescent BMI, and the rising prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents, may account for a substantial and growing future burden of cardiovascular disease, particularly coronary heart disease.""

The benefits of physical activity are well known. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that regular physical activity can reduce the risk of severe illnesses, such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. 

Exercise can also improve one's overall physical and mental health, as well as increase longevity.   

If you are looking to control your weight, the advantages of exercise are numerous. Not only has physical activity been shown to reduce metabolic syndrome - which means that it is good for regulating one's metabolism - but it also burns calories, and in combination with a healthful diet, exercise can help to maintain weight over a long period of time. 

While many people are aware of the benefits of physical activity in theory, many of us find it particularly hard in practice to stay physically active. New research may help to explain why this is so. 

Lead researcher Alexxai V. Kravitz - of the Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Obesity Branch at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) - wondered why it is that obese animals have such a hard time doing physical activity. 

The common perception is that animals, or people that are obese, are less physically active because they have to carry much more body weight. However, because Kravitz has a background in Parkinson's disease, he noticed similarities between obese mice and Parkinsonian mice while he was studying.

This triggered his hypothesis that perhaps something else could contribute to physical inactivity.
""We know that physical activity is linked to overall good health, but not much is known about why people or animals with obesity are less active. There is a common belief that obese animals don't move as much because carrying extra body weight is physically disabling. But our findings suggest that assumption does not explain the whole story."" Alexxai V. Kravitz
Kravitz hypothesized that a dysfunction in rodents' dopamine system might help to explain their lack of physical activity. 

""Other studies have connected dopamine signaling defects to obesity, but most of them have looked at reward processing - how animals feel when they eat different foods. We looked at something simpler: dopamine is critical for movement, and obesity is associated with a lack of movement. Can problems with dopamine signaling alone explain the inactivity?""

Researchers set out to examine dopamine signaling in lean and obese mice, and 
the findings were published in the journal Cell Metabolism.

To do this, they fed a group of eight mice a normal diet, and they fed another group a high-fat diet for 18 weeks. 

Starting from week 2, the mice on a high-fat diet started gaining significantly more weight than the lean ones. By week 4, obese mice spent less time moving, had fewer movements, and were slower when they did move, compared with lean mice. 

Scientists examined whether changes in movement correlated with body weight gain, and they found that it did not. Interestingly, the mice on a high-fat diet moved less before they gained the majority of the weight, which suggests that the extra weight could not have been responsible for the reduced movement. 

To identify the mechanisms behind physical inactivity, Kravitz and team quantified several aspects of dopamine signaling. 

They found that the D-2 type receptor (D2R) binding, found in the striatum, was reduced in obese mice. This was consistent with previous research in rodents. 

Then, scientists genetically removed D2Rs from the striatum of lean mice to determine if there was a causal link between D2Rs and inactivity. Researchers then placed the lean mice on a high-fat diet. 

Surprisingly, they found that these mice did not gain more weight, despite their physical inactivity. 

This suggests that although deficits in striatal D2R contribute to physical inactivity in obesity, such inactivity is more ""a consequence than a cause of obesity,"" as the authors put it. 

Although ""there are probably other factors involved as well, the deficit in D2 is sufficient to explain the lack of activity,"" says Danielle Friend, first author of the study and former NIDDK postdoctoral fellow.

Kravitz mentions that his future research will examine the connection between diet and dopamine signaling. Kravitz and team will investigate whether unhealthful eating affects dopamine signaling, and how quickly mice recover to normal activity levels once they start eating healthfully and losing weight. 

Finally, Kravitz hopes that his research will help to relieve some of the stigma faced by people with obesity. 

""In many cases, willpower is invoked as a way to modify behavior. But if we don't understand the underlying physical basis for that behavior, it is difficult to say that willpower alone can solve it.""

A new way of sparing couples the trauma of having to decide between having a baby with a high risk of developing a form of  colorectal cancer  later in life, or terminating the pregnancy, will be revealed in June 2006 at the 22nd annual conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Prague, Czech Republic. Professor Stephane Viville, director of the biology of reproduction service at Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France, will tell the conference that, using his team's new test, it will be possible to offer preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to almost all cases of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an adult-onset  cancer  which represents 1% of all cases of colorectal cancer.
   
PGD was originally proposed for couples at risk of having a child affected by severe genetic disorders such as  cystic fibrosis , which manifest themselves at birth or in very early childhood. However, it is now possible to test for some diseases that occur at a later stage in life, such as  Huntington's disease  and some hereditary cancers. ""Because the child will carry only a risk - albeit it a high one - of developing these conditions during adulthood, many parents, as well as clinicians, have doubts about terminating such a pregnancy,"" Professor Viville says. ""In fact some couples would prefer not to have children in these circumstances.""
   
Twelve couples with a risk of passing on FAP to any children were referred to Professor Viville and his team between 2000 and 2005. At first the team worked on tests to detect the most common FAP mutation, but then, by carrying out double and triple diagnostic tests on each cell, were able to detect the many rarer mutations that are involved in familial cases. ""Because the pathology is dominant, and only one member of the couple is affected and at risk of transmitting the disease,"" said Professor Viville, ""we only have to look for one mutation at a time.
   
""But there are a number of these mutations and therefore it is necessary to develop a different test for each if we are to be sure that PGD will be effective. Our test is very robust as well as being technically innovative - for the first time in this disease we have been able to use molecular technology at the single cell level, which allows us to detect mutations that are otherwise very difficult to identify.""
   
The team started eleven IVF cycles, of which nine gave rise to embryo biopsy and eight had an embryo transfer. From these, one boy has been born and two other pregnancies are on-going. Reanalysis of eleven un-transferred embryos confirmed PGD results for FAP mutations.
   
""We are now able to propose PGD to most couples at risk of transmitting a familial form of FAP to their children"", says Professor Viville. ""With our experience growing all the time, we hope that we will shortly be able to develop new protocols which will enable us to offer PGD for all mutations involved in FAP, including those which occur for the first time.""

While it is wise to avoid burning [Kennedy et al., 2003] or excess tanning from solar or indoor ultraviolet radiation (UVR), it should be realized that solar UVB radiation (290-315 nm) is the primary source of  vitamin D  for most Americans and Europeans.  Dietary sources are inadequate and supplements have to be used carefully.    
Mid-day summer sun is the best source of UVB, since minimal exposure times are required, and the UVB to UVA (315-400 nm) ratio is highest.  If using sunscreen, it might be advisable to go into the sun for 10-15 minutes without sunscreen to generate a day's worth of  vitamin  D.  
   
As for  melanoma  and other  skin cancer , several points should be made.  First, while UVR generates free radicals that can do some of the damage, dietary  antioxidants  and skin pigmentation are nature's way of fighting free radicals.  A recent paper by Millen et al. [2004] reported that diets high in antioxidants and low in fats and alcohol can reduce the risk of melanoma by about 50%.  Smoking is also a risk factor for non-melanoma skin cancer.  Second, occupational exposure to UVR is associated with reduced risk of melanoma [Kennedy et al., 2003].     

The health benefits of UVB through production of vitamin D are considerable, with more benefits being recognized at a rapid pace.  My work indicates that over 20,000 Americans die prematurely annually from insufficient UVB/vitamin D [Grant, 2002].  I also estimate that half of those with  multiple sclerosis  in the U.S. would not have MS if they had as much UVB exposure as those living in the southern states.

Today, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), UK,  releases guidance that recommends that all eligible patients have access to a  prostate cancer  drug[1] - a move that will affect the lives of thousands of men across the UK[2].    
 
Taxotere? (docetaxel) - which has been routinely given to female patients with late stage  breast cancer  since 2001[3] - extends the lives of men with late stage prostate cancer (metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer - mHRPC) and improves their quality of life[4].    
 
Prostate cancer is the most common  cancer  of men in the UK; over 30,000 men are diagnosed with the condition each year[5].  In addition, it is the second most common form of cancer death, annually killing over 10,000 men - that's approximately one death every hour[2].  Although data is limited, it is believed that the majority of these deaths are due to late stage prostate cancer[6].  Late stage prostate cancer is a form of prostate cancer in which patients have become resistant to conventional treatments (hormone therapy).    
 
Patients and patient groups welcome today's guidance and are calling for all men who could benefit to be given immediate access to the treatment, which could extend their lives and improve their quality of life for their remaining months.  ?NICE guidance supporting the use of Taxotere (docetaxel) based regimens for women with late stage breast cancer has been available since 2001,? says John Anderson, CEO, Prostate Research Campaign UK.  ?It's about time that men are also able to get to the front of the queue to gain equal access to a treatment that could benefit them. Now that the guidance has arrived there is no excuse for men who could benefit not to get access as quickly as possible. ?    
 
?Taxotere (docetaxel) is the first treatment to improve survival, improve quality of life and reverse progress of metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer,? Professor Nick James, Consultant Clinical Oncologist, University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust (Queen Elizabeth Cancer Centre), Birmingham and UK principal investigator on TAX 327.  ?Now that NICE have supported the use of this treatment, we urge all PCTs to ensure that funding is available for all patients whom could benefit.  It is now up to patients to make sure that they are asking for this treatment, clinicians to offer it and PCTs to fund it.?    
 
?The provision of Taxotere (docetaxel) is one of the most important advances in treating late stage prostate cancer that has occurred in recent years,? says John Anderson, Consultant Urological Surgeon, Sheffield.  ?Now that we have been able to demonstrate that Taxotere is able to extend survival and manage quality of life in late stage prostate cancer, exciting trials have been initiated which will examine the benefits of Taxotere in early stage prostate cancer.?    
 
NICE's guidance was based on the highly influential TAX 327 trial, published in a well-respected journal, the New England Journal of Medicine, in October 2004.  The trial found that Taxotere? (docetaxel), plus prednisolone (prednisone), improved overall patient survival by 24%.  Median patient survival with the Taxotere based regimen was 18.9 months compared to 16.5 months for the standard treatment (mitoxantrone).    
 
Taxotere? (docetaxel) is recommended, within its licensed indications, as a treatment option for men with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer only if their Karnofsky performance-status score is 60% or more.  The Karnofsky score is a measure of quality of life factors.    
 
Taxotere? (docetaxel) has an acceptable increase of side effects.  The most commonly reported adverse reaction associated with Taxotere? (docetaxel) is neutropaenia (low white cell count, which may lead to infection), which is reversible and not cumulative[7].    
 
Other common side effects include flushing, skin rash, chest tightness,  back pain , anaemia, nausea, sore mouth and taste change,  diarrhoea ,  hair loss , hypersensitivity and  tiredness .

282,271786,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/313889.php,"Type 2 diabetes caused by buildup of toxic fat, study suggests",Diabetes,Diabetes,Obesity / Weight Loss / Fitness,Nutrition / Diet,,4,3,2,4,2,2,5,2,3,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,,"
Over 29 million Americans, or 9.3 percent of the United States population, live with diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90-95 percent of all these cases. 


In type 1 diabetes, patients do not produce enough of the hormone insulin. In type 2 diabetes, although the body produces insulin, it cannot use it properly. 


Insulin is secreted by the pancreas when it detects sugar intake. Insulin enables cells to accept glucose, which is then processed by the cells and turned into energy. 



In patients whose insulin is not administered effectively, glucose is not assimilated by the cells but instead builds up in the bloodstream. Diabetes occurs when levels of blood sugar are abnormally high. 



Although being overweight or obese is a common risk factor for diabetes, researchers have pointed out that diabetes can still occur in people of a healthy weight. 


Previous research has found that 12 percent of people diagnosed with diabetes between 1990-2011 were at normal weight. The same research indicates that once diagnosed, normal-weight participants were more likely to die from diabetes than their heavier counterparts. 


Reasons for this were unknown, until now. New research may have shed light on not only why people of a healthy weight are still prone to type 2 diabetes, but also why some people are more susceptible to it than others. 

It could be that a certain kind of fat is what makes people prone to type 2 diabetes, regardless of their weight. 
Senior author Scott Summers, Ph.D., chairman of the University of Utah Department of Nutrition and Integrative Physiology, believes it might be a toxic class of fat metabolites called ceramides that causes type 2 diabetes.


The new research from Summer and team shows that a buildup of ceramides prevents the fat tissue from working normally in mice. 



When we overeat, some of the excess fat gets either stored or burned for energy. But for some people, excess fat just turns into ceramides. 
""Ceramides impact the way the body handles nutrients. They impair the way the body responds to insulin, and also how it burns calories.""
Scott Summers, Ph.D.When too many ceramides accumulate in the fat tissue, the body reaches a ""tipping point,"" as Summers puts it. Fat tissue stops working properly, and fat overspills into the blood vessels, heart, or goes on to damage the peripheral tissues.   


Ceramides have previously been linked to diabetes by at least three different mechanisms: they cause the death of pancreatic beta cells, they increase insulin resistance, and they reduce insulin gene expression. 


The new study further emphasizes the role of ceramides in creating insulin resistance. 

Adding extra ceramides to fat cells in mice made them insulin-resistant and unable to burn calories. Conversely, mice that had fewer ceramides did not develop any insulin resistance. 


Mice with excessive ceramides were also more likely to develop diabetes and fatty liver disease. 


The results of the study were published in the latest issue of Cell Metabolism. 
This study suggests that some people are predisposed to turning excess fat into ceramides instead of calories. 

""[The research] suggests some skinny people will get diabetes or fatty liver disease if something such as genetics triggers ceramide accumulation,"" said lead author Bhagirath Chaurasia, assistant professor at the University of Utah.

Summers points out that some Asian countries have a higher diabetes rate than the U.S., even though the obesity rate is relatively low. 


Diabetes has already been linked to certain races/ethnicities, with African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, some Asians, and Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders being at a particularly high risk for type 2 diabetes, according to the CDC. 

""Some people are just not made to deal with dietary fat,"" says Summers. ""It's not just how much you eat, because some people can eat a lot and they just store all the fat effectively and remain healthy.""

As a consequence, the scientists are now looking at genetic mutations that might make people predisposed to accumulating ceramides.    

According to the researchers, ceramide levels predict the existence of diabetes in humans better than obesity. Patients in Singapore who received gastric bypass surgery, although all obese, had different levels of ceramides in their body. Those with lower levels did not have type 2 diabetes, whereas those diagnosed with the disease had higher levels of the toxic metabolites. 

Summers is currently working to develop drugs that might inhibit ceramide synthesis. 

""By blocking ceramide production, we might be able to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes or other metabolic conditions, at least in some people,"" adds Chaurasia.

Between 2012 and 2015, the number of chemical burns to the eye associated with laundry detergent pods increased more than 30-fold among preschool-aged children in the U.S., according to a study published online by JAMA Ophthalmology.

The widespread adoption of laundry detergent pods, which are dissolvable pouches containing enough laundry detergent for a single use, has led to an increase in associated injuries among children. Reports of pod-related injuries, including poisoning, choking, and burns, have suggested that this pattern may be in part due to the products' colorful packaging and candy-like appearance.

R. Sterling Haring, D.O., M.P.H., of Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, and colleagues examined the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS; run by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission) for the period 2010-2015 for eye injuries resulting in chemical burn or conjunctivitis among children age 3 to 4 years (i.e., preschool-aged children).

During this time period, 1,201 laundry detergent pod-related ocular burns occurred among children age 3 to 4 years. The number of chemical burns associated with laundry detergent pods increased from 12 instances in 2012 to 480 in 2015; the proportion of all chemical ocular injuries associated with these devices increased from 0.8 percent of burns in 2012 to 26 percent in 2015. These injuries most often occurred when children were handling the pods and the contents squirted into one or both of their eyes or when the pod contents leaked onto their hands and a burn resulted from subsequent hand-eye contact.

""These data suggest that the role of laundry detergent pods in eye injuries among preschool-aged children is growing. As with most injuries in this age group, these burns occurred almost exclusively in the home. In addition to proper storage and use of these devices, prevention strategies might include redesigning packaging to reduce the attractiveness of these products to young children and improving their strength and durability,"" the authors write.

284,273057,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315170.php,Cutting salt intake by 10 percent would be 'highly cost effective worldwide',Public Health,Public Health,Nutrition / Diet,Cardiovascular / Cardiology,,4,3,2,4,5,2,4,3,1,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,,"So concludes a new British and American study led by Tufts University in Boston, MA, which was published in The BMJ. The team suggests that such a low-cost approach to salt reduction is a ""best buy"" for governments.Consuming too much sodium contributes to high blood pressure and increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as heart disease and stroke. Salt is the main source of sodium in the diet.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the majority of people consume too much salt - between 9-12 grams per day on average, which is around twice the recommended maximum level of 5 grams per day.WHO estimates suggest that excess salt intake results in 1,648,000 annual deaths from heart diseases worldwide.The researchers note that studies in a limited number of high-income countries find that national policies to reduce salt intake have been highly cost effective for reducing high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.The WHO suggest there is evidence that key salt reduction measures ""generate an extra year of healthy life for a cost that falls below the average annual income or gross domestic product per person.""However, the researchers note that it is not clear whether this applies to most countries.For their study, the researchers set out to measure the cost effectiveness of what they describe as a ""soft regulation"" national policy to reduce salt intake by 10 percent over 10 years in 183 countries.The policy - which is modeled on the United Kingdom's recent program - combines ""targeted industry agreements, government monitoring, and public education"" to reduce people's salt intake.To account for differences across countries, the researchers evaluated a range of scenarios with varying amounts of daily sodium reductions achieved over 10 years.They also characterized (each by age and sex for the 183 countries): blood pressure levels, global sodium intakes, and the effects of sodium on blood pressure, as well as the effect of blood pressure on heart disease and stroke, and cardiovascular disease rates in 2010.To assess the costs of implementing a sodium reduction policy in each country, they used the WHO Noncommunicable Diseases Costing Tool.The researchers used comparative risk assessments to work out the country-specific impacts on disease burden in disability adjusted life years (DALYs), a measure of the years lost to ill health, disability, or early death.They expressed the main result in terms of international dollars (I$) per DALY saved over 10 years (from 2011-2020). I$ are equivalent to the country's purchasing power of U.S. dollars.The analysis shows that worldwide, a 10 percent reduction in salt intake over 10 years in each country would prevent 5.8 million DALYs per year from cardiovascular diseases. The cost associated with the policy intervention would be I$1.13 per person over the 10 years.Worldwide, the average cost effectiveness of the 10 year program was estimated to be approximately I$204 per DALY saved.The authors note that this figure is in the same ballpark as cost effectiveness ratios of many drugs for preventing cardiovascular diseases.Across nine world regions, the team found that the estimated cost effectiveness of reducing salt intake was best in South Asia (I$116 per DALY), and across the world's 30 most populated countries, it was best in Uzbekistan (I$26.08 per DALY) and Myanmar (I$33.30 per DALY).To keep their cost effectiveness estimates on the conservative side, the researchers did not evaluate healthcare savings that might accrue from preventing ill health; they only evaluated program costs.While acknowledging that the study has some limitations, the researchers are confident - especially in the light of previous studies in selected countries - of their findings and conclude that:

Alcohol is a significantly calorific compound; it contains 7 kilocalories per gram, compared with 4 kilocalories per gram in carbohydrate and 9 in fat.

In a glass of wine, there are 83 calories, meaning that three glasses can make up more than 10 percent of an individual's recommended energy intake.

This high calorie content means that, if alcohol is consumed, it becomes very easy to take in more calories across a day than our body needs.

Because alcohol is globally popular and obesity is on the rise, understanding the interplay between alcohol and food is more important than ever.

Research looking at the way alcohol affects appetite and overall calorie intake in humans has been contradictory. Some studies have shown an increase in appetite and food intake with alcohol consumption, whereas others have demonstrated the reverse effect.

A team of scientists from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign decided to take a fresh look at these interactions. 

The investigators ran a series of studies using a rat model. They chose rats over mice because, in some ways, they are more similar to humans. Rats are bigger mammals and eat more food, making it easier to quantify; they also show similar feeding-related patterns and brain circuits to humans.

If laboratory rats are provided with alcohol, many of them will consume it until they are tipsy. However, they rarely drink until they are drunk - in other words, they will not binge drink.

The team of researchers, led by Prof. Nu-Chu Liang, found that when the rats had consumed a moderate amount of alcohol, they consumed less food, keeping their caloric intake at the same level as it would have been if they had not consumed alcohol.
""I was looking at whether alcohol intake affects overall caloric intake and body weight change. And the result, in terms of voluntary drinking, is that it does not - at least in rats.""Nu-Chu Liang
However, things changed if the rats were injected with alcohol - to mimic binge drinking. Under these circumstances, the rats actually consumed fewer calories overall and began to lose weight. Even if the equivalent to 50 percent of their daily calorie intake was injected in the form of alcohol, they would still, overall, consume less calories across the day.

The study makes an interesting contribution to the existing contradictory literature on this topic. However, it does have some limitations, and whether it can be applied to humans is still very much up for debate. Firstly, some studies in humans do show that moderate alcohol appears to stimulate appetite, so the answer can not be clear cut.

Also, as the authors mention, the rats in this study were being fed their standard lab chow every day. This is substantially different to situations in which humans generally drink alcohol. Often, when humans are drinking - for instance, in a restaurant - they have a range of food options; this can artificially encourage appetite. 

Additionally, there is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the significant effect of social situations on appetite and eating behavior.

For this reason, Prof. Liang wishes to extend her work to mimic this type of situation; perhaps by providing a range of novel or high-calorie foods in the rat's cages.

The researchers are quick to point out that, although alcohol intoxication appears to reduce caloric intake, it is not a good weight-loss model for humans. She says: ""In this case, high blood alcohol levels suppress appetite and suppress weight gain, but it's more like the loss of appetite and weight loss during sickness.""

Further research will be needed to pick apart the complex interactions between calorie intake and alcohol consumption; the debate is far from settled.

In a new twist on the Confucian ideal of filial piety, a study finds that the assistance of daughters-in-law - but not their own children - helps mitigate  depression  among older people in China. This is particularly true in rural areas, where elders may rely more heavily on family to be support providers.
   
""The inability to secure assistance from children may induce depression not only because needs are likely to go unmet but because the absence of such support may induce feelings of helplessness and strain intergenerational relations,"" says Zhen Cong, who received her Ph.D. in May 2008 from the USC Davis School of Gerontology.
   
Cong and Professor Merril Silverstein of the USC Davis School of Gerontology were intrigued by earlier findings showing that intergenerational support, particularly hands-on care, had inconsistent effects on the psychological well-being of Chinese elders.
   
""Unlike emotional and financial support, instrumental support - in spite of its apparent cultural and practical significance - has shown inconsistent effects on the psychological well-being,"" Silverstein explains.
   
Cong and Silverstein looked at rural Anhui province, where rates of depression are twice that of their urban counterparts (though still much lower than in the West). They found that ""instrumental support"" - such as personal care and household chores - had a positive effect on well-being, depending on who was providing the service.
   
When women shared a home with their in-laws, their presence and support was particularly beneficial to the psychological well-being of older mothers. Daughters-in-law provided the overwhelming majority of personal care for older women in a household, the researchers found.
   
However, household support and personal care from sons was particularly damaging and increased depressive symptoms, according to the study, appearing in the August 2008 issue of the  Journal of Marriage and Family. 
   
Similarly, mothers who received an increase in household support from daughters-in-law had fewer depressive symptoms, while those who experienced an increase in household support from their own daughters had more depressive symptoms.
   
""A general pattern emerged that supported the prolific and meaningful contributions of daughters-in-law in the support systems of older people in rural China,"" Silverstein says.
   
The study confirms prior research by Silverstein and others showing that perceived appropriateness of support is often more important to subjective well being than the support itself.
   
As Cong explains: ""Aversion to household support from daughters and sons was sufficiently strong among older mothers and fathers to cause negative psychological outcomes, affirming the adverse emotional consequences that result when traditional expectations are violated.""
   
The researchers note that almost two-thirds of the older population in China lives in rural areas, making it the largest concentration of older adults in the world.
   
""Our results suggest that attachment to traditional expectations for support may make elders more depressed in such a rapidly changing society as China,"" says Cong. ""Elders will be psychologically disadvantaged unless they contemporize their expectations to match the changing social realities of Chinese society.""

A Henry Ford Hospital study has found that common asthma symptoms like waking up in the middle of the night and shortness of breath are associated with increased levels of stress and anxiety in teens with asthma.

In a small study of 38 asthma patients ages 14-17, researchers found that their average scores for stress and anxiety levels were higher than those seen in the general population.

Researchers suggest the findings are a red flag for physicians of young asthma patients.

""Because these patients may be particularly vulnerable to stress and anxiety, this information can be helpful to physicians as they counsel their patients about the importance of managing their asthma,"" says Cathryn Luria, M.D., a Henry Ford fellow and the study's lead author.

""While we found a link between asthma symptoms and stress and anxiety, it's not clear which came first - the symptoms or the stress and anxiety. More study is needed to determine that.""

Asthma affects an estimated 25.7 million people, including 7 million children ages 18 and under, according to the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention. While the cause of asthma is unknown, most people can control their symptoms with medication.

The study, published in the journal Evolution, Medicine and Public Health, was led by Prof. Andrew Higginson, from the University of Exeter, and Prof. John McNamara, of the University of Bristol, both in the United Kingdom.

Keeping weight in check is a health benefit; compared with people of a healthy weight, people who are obese are at increased risk for many diseases. 

For instance, the risk of high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke are all higher in the obese population.

More than one-third of adults in the United States are obese, so keeping weight at a healthy level is a major priority from a public health perspective.

Although shedding holiday pounds may be a popular focus for many of us in January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), say that people who lose weight gradually - about 1-2 pounds per week - are more successful at keeping the weight off.

Previous studies have investigated the negative health effects of yo-yo dieting. One study recently presented by the American Heart Association suggested that yo-yo dieting increases the risk of heart disease death.

For the latest study on yo-yo dieting, the researchers utilized a mathematical model of animals - such as birds - that knows when food is in abundance or is scarce but does not know when the situation will change.

The researchers note that animals respond to food shortages by storing energy and gaining weight. 

Their model demonstrates that when food is in short supply - much like during a phase of dieting - an efficient animal will gain excess weight between periods of food shortage.

""Surprisingly,"" says Prof. Higginson, ""our model predicts that the average weight gain for dieters will actually be greater than those who never diet. This happens because non-dieters learn that the food supply is reliable so there is less need for the insurance of fat stores.""

Prof. McNamara adds that their model ""shows that weight gain does not mean people's physiology is malfunctioning or that they are being overwhelmed by unnaturally sweet tastes."" 

It could be that their brain is working normally, ""but uncertainty about the food supply triggers the evolved response to gain weight,"" he adds.

The researchers say their model shows that the desire to eat increases as a diet continues, and this desire will not go away as weight is gained. This is because the brain thinks that further famines are likely. 

The model may explain why many people get into a cycle of weight gain in the wake of increasingly restrictive diets; it only serves to communicate to the brain that it must store fat. 

For those of us who over-indulge during the holiday season, however, what is the best way to lose weight?

""The best thing for weight loss is to take it steady. Our work suggests that eating only slightly less than you should, all the time, and doing physical exercise is much more likely to help you reach a healthy weight than going on low-calorie diets.""
Prof. Andrew Higginson, University of Exeter
The CDC offer some good advice for healthy weight loss. Because 1 pound equals 3,500 calories, they recommend reducing caloric intake by 500-1,000 calories per day to lose 1-2 pounds per week.

Once a healthy weight is achieved, the CDC say to rely on healthful eating and physical activity most days of the week to keep the weight off over the long term.

Even a modest weight loss will confer health benefits, such as improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars, the organization adds.

Men over 50 years old are more motivated to seek screening for the  skin cancer  melanoma if they are made aware of the risk factors through public education and have access to screening exams, according to a new study. Published in the August 15, 2006 issue of  CANCER , a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society, the study reveals that men who had skin lesions removed previously, who were concerned about a mole, or who had identified personal risk factors for  melanoma  were more likely to undergo a whole body skin exam. This community-based, melanoma screening intervention significantly increased screening rates in this older age group.
   
Melanoma is one of the deadliest types of skin cancer. It arises from pigmented cells called melanocytes, most commonly found in the skin, and once invasive, will rapidly spread throughout the body. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation is known to greatly increase risk. Though the incidence of all skin cancers is on the rise, rates of melanomas have increased most rapidly, almost 15-fold, over the last 50 years. That increase has been observed over-proportionally in men over 50 years. Currently, this group represents almost half of all deaths from melanoma in developed countries, but is the least likely age group to be screened.
   
Joanne Aitken, Ph.D. of the Viertel Centre for Research in Cancer Control, Queensland Cancer Fund in Brisbane, Australia and investigators conducted a melanoma screening intervention trial in 18 communities in Queensland, Australia. Nine communities were randomly selected to participate in a three-year public education campaign that comprised community education, local physician education, and the establishment of easily accessible dedicated skin screening clinics. No intervention was done in the other nine communities. Subjects were then followed for two years after the intervention. Investigators previously reported that the intervention significantly increased screening rates. The most significant improvement was observed in men over 50. To evaluate the factors that motivated older men to pursue screening for melanoma, the authors compared the results of telephone interviews conducted at the beginning and end of the trial and two years after the intervention.
   
Close to 500 men over 50 completed each of the surveys. Older men who had a suspicious skin lesion removed in the past, were concerned about an existing mole, recognized personal risk factors for melanoma, or had a positive impression of screening were more likely to conduct a whole body skin exam on themselves or receive a whole body skin exam from a doctor. Men not confident in their abilities to conduct a self-exam were more likely to receive screening at baseline and at the end of the intervention. However, after the intervention, men confident in their self-exam skills were more likely to have continued screening practices.
   
Men over 50 accounted for over 20 percent of screening visits and almost 50 percent of all melanomas diagnosed. At the end of the study, the self-screening rate increased two-fold and the physician-screening rate increased four-fold. The authors say that recommendations and instructions from doctors are important for improving men's skin self-examination behavior although ""we did not observe a significant increase in doctors recommending such skin self-examination behavior"" within this program.
   
According to the authors, this is the first published report of the motivating factors for screening and melanoma diagnosis patterns in this age group in a population-based, melanoma screening initiative. ""Our results,"" conclude the authors, ""suggest that to sustain screening rates in men 50 years and older, an understanding of their susceptibility to melanoma and their doctor's encouragement of early detection and screening behavior will be important.""

A survey of adult survivors of childhood  cancers  found that more than one out of eight reported having  suicidal thoughts  or previous attempts to take their lives many years after they were treated, say scientists at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
   
The suicidal symptoms were reported by more than 12 percent -- a greater proportion than had been expected -- of patients seen at a clinic providing care for adult cancer survivors, the researchers write in the August 20 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology. The findings should prompt providers at survivor clinics to consider the interaction of physical and emotional factors in their follow-up evaluations of patients, they said.
   
""Most people are doing fine, but there is a serious concern about the minority of survivors who have thoughts of ending their lives,"" said Christopher Recklitis, PhD, MPH, a psychologist and director of research in the Perini Family Survivors' Center at Dana-Farber. He is lead author of the paper.
   
The senior author is Lisa Diller, MD, chief medical officer of Dana-Farber/Children's Hospital Cancer Care and clinical director of Pediatric Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital Boston.
   
Previous studies have noted a temporary rise in suicidal thoughts among patients in the months after a cancer diagnosis. The new study is the first to substantiate a significant level of suicidality many years or even decades after treatment for childhood cancers, and to suggest a link with physical functioning in the survivorship period
   
Recklitis and colleagues conducted the study with the participation of 226 adult survivors of childhood cancer - 100 men and 126 women - with a mean age of 28.
   
The participants were interview an average of 18 years after their initial diagnosis with a range of childhood cancers including  lymphomas , leukemias,  sarcomas , and  Wilms' tumor . Individuals diagnosed with brain tumors were not included in the group.
   
The study participants completed standard rating scales evaluating quality-of-life, suicidal thoughts, signs of  depression , pain, and physical health. All together 29 survivors reported some suicidal symptoms.
   
Nineteen patients reported suicidal thoughts alone, one had made a previous attempt but no longer was troubled by suicidal thoughts, and nine participants said they had made suicide attempts and were currently thinking about suicide. Only 11 of these 29 survivors were considered to be significantly depressed on the basis of their rating scales, suggesting that identifying survivors with suicidal thoughts requires more than asking patients about depression.
   
Data analysis showed that factors associated with more suicidal symptoms included younger age at diagnosis, a greater time having passed since diagnosis, and radiation treatments to the head. The latter form of treatment - used less frequently and in smaller doses today - can cause growth retardation and physical disfigurement, impairments in memory and cognitive functions, and increased risk of second cancers.
   
Patients were also more likely to report suicidal symptoms if they felt depressed or hopeless, were in pain, had problems with physical function, or were concerned about their appearance.
   
""The association with physical health and pain is important,"" the authors wrote, ""because these represent potentially treatable conditions for which survivors may seek follow-up care.""
   
In revealing the complex relationships of physical and mental well being with suicidality, the study ""underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach to survivor care.""
   
With the growth of survivors' clinics across the country, it is important to improve psychological screening methods ""that aren't intrusive, but get us to this important information,"" said Recklitis, who is also a clinical instructor in psychology at Harvard Medical School.

Blood sugars that are too high can cause symptoms such as dry mouth, increased thirst, frequent urination, tiredness, and increased urination at night. High blood sugar levels over time can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and blood vessels. 

What people eat has a huge impact on their blood sugars.  Carbohydrates found in foods cause blood sugar to go up. Foods that digest slower cause a slower rise in blood sugar, which is helpful for those with diabetes.

But what about protein shakes?

Contents of this article:

The three essential macronutrients found in food are protein, carbohydrates, and fat.

Protein helps to maintain, rebuild, and repair muscle. Protein is also a building block for the skin, nails, bones, and even blood. It makes up hormones, enzymes, and antibodies.  Protein in foods has staying power because it digests slower than carbohydrate. Proteins do not raise blood sugar.

Periods of growth, such as during infancy and pregnancy, need more protein. Protein needs are also raised for people with injuries, those who have had surgery, or active people.

Most people, including those with diabetes, are looking for healthy options to grab on the go like protein shakes or bars. While it is important to rely on packaged food products as little as possible, it is smart to have some healthier options in mind when needed.

The problem with protein shakes is that they often have lots of artificial ingredients and can have as much sugar as soda.

The total amount of protein consumed in a day is important, but so is how that intake is spread out over the day.

Many people will consume a small amount at breakfast, a moderate amount at lunch, and a large amount at dinner:

A typical day might include:

However, the body can only absorb and use so much protein at one time. The body uses what it can and then creates waste with the leftover. Instead of having 60 grams of protein in one meal, it is more beneficial to spread that 60 grams out into three to four meals of 15-20 grams each.

The recommended dietary allowance, or RDA, for protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight each day. This is the minimum amount of protein needed for meeting nutritional requirements, not the maximum.

Endurance athletes need 1.2 to 1.4 grams per kilogram of body weight, and power athletes require 1.2 to 1.7 grams per kilogram of body weight. The more active a person is, the more protein their body needs.

Increasing protein intake or taking protein supplements alone does not increase muscle. People have to do the work in the gym to see any result.

People often need 15-30 grams of protein after a hard workout to repair and start to rebuild muscle. The amount of protein needed depends on body size.

Carbohydrates should be eaten with the protein to help refuel the muscle and ""spare"" the protein for repairing and rebuilding the muscle.

If someone is unable to eat a meal after exercise or they are simply just not hungry, they can grab something easy like a bar or a shake instead.

There are two different types of protein shake: those that are made with a protein powder mixed with a liquid and those that come ready to drink (RTD).

The easiest way to get a healthy protein shake is to make it at home, starting with a high-quality protein powder.

Most of the common protein powders at the local grocery store or supplement shop are filled with artificial sweeteners and unnecessary chemicals. To avoid these, look at the ingredient label. A buyer should be able to read the label and recognize each ingredient as food. 

The two most common types of protein powders are whey-based and plant-based. Whey based powders get their protein from milk, and plant-based powders use a variety of things such as soy, peas, nuts, rice, or hemp.

Although many whey proteins claim to be lactose-free, some people have a hard time digesting them. There is also a difference between being lactose intolerant and allergic to milk. Those who are allergic to milk are allergic to the protein in milk, and thus need to avoid milk protein powers.

The following people should choose a plant-based protein powder:

People can mix protein powder with plain water, but this will likely not be enough for a complete meal or snack. Protein powders are often lacking complex carbohydrates or healthy fats.

People with diabetes should limit sweeteners like sugar, agave, or fruit juice in their shakes or smoothies. They should also beware of smoothie shops that label their drinks as healthy, as many can have more sugar than the typical person should have in a day.

To make a more nutritious, complete meal or snack shake, people can use this easy formula:

Easy post-workout or meal replacement shake formula

All ingredients should be mixed in a blender until smooth. Optional add-ins for bonus nutrition include:

To find a good RTD protein shake for people with diabetes, first look at the sugar content. Try to avoid those with added sugar. Some RTD shakes can have 30 or more grams of added sugars.

People with diabetes can always add their own sweetener to the shake so they can control the sugar content. Adding whole fruit gives some good fiber and sweetness naturally. Berries, bananas, and other soft fruits can be added easily to premade shakes.

Next, people with diabetes should look at the ingredients. Many protein shakes have artificial sweeteners, refined oils, artificial colors, and flavorings. It is best to steer clear of ingredients that are not recognizable as food.

People with diabetes should be sure to eat on a regular schedule. It is ideal to eat every 4 to 5 hours while awake. Having a source of complex carbohydrate, lean protein, and healthy fat with each meal or snack will help to control blood sugar throughout the day.

They should also limit quick-digesting carbohydrates like pasta and white bread. It is best to opt for slower-digesting carbohydrates with additional nutrients such as:

These complex carbohydrates cause a smaller spike in blood sugar and are even better when paired with a lean protein and healthy fat.

People with diabetes that have existing kidney conditions may need to limit their protein intake.

For people without kidney disease, most studies support an intake of up to 2 grams per kilogram of body weight without any adverse effects. However, intakes above 2.5 grams per kilogram of body weight put people at risk of the following:

Eating more than 200 to 400 grams of protein each day can exceed the liver's ability to turn excess nitrogen to urea. This can lead to nausea, diarrhea, and other adverse side effects.

More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease and by 2050, this number is expected to increase to 16 million. With figures like these, the race is on to find ways to prevent  Alzheimer's. Now, a new study by researchers from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, NY, finds that a cocoa extract could do just that.

The research team, led by Dr. Giulio Maria Pasinetti, a professor of neurology at the Icahn School of Medicine, found that a cocoa extract - called lavado - may reduce or block damage to nerve pathways found in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This means that symptoms of the condition - such as cognitive decline - could be prevented.

According to the investigators, lavado cocoa extract is a minimally processed cocoa that is high in polyphenols - antioxidants that are also found in fruits and vegetables. Past research has indicated that polyphenol-rich diets may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.

With this in mind, the team wanted to see how lavado cocoa extract - alongside natural and Dutched cocoa extracts - affected disease progression.

To reach their findings, recently published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, the team genetically engineered mice to mimic the human form of Alzheimer's disease.

Each of the three cocoa extracts were tested on the mice, and the lavado cocoa extract was found to be the most effective against Alzheimer's. It reduced the formation of Aβ oligomers in the brains of the mice and reduced damage to synapses.

The team explains that Aβ oligomers are groups of molecules that clump together and disturb synaptic structures in the brain that are responsible for the function of memory circuits. 

The Aβ oligomers activate inflammatory responses with the intention of destroying a foreign body, but they actually cause damage to the brain's own cells.

""Our data suggest that lavado cocoa extract prevents the abnormal formation of Aβ into clumped oligomeric structures, to prevent synaptic insult and eventually cognitive decline,"" says, Dr. Pasinetti, adding:
""Given that cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is thought to start decades before symptoms appear, we believe our results have broad implications for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.""
Dutched cocoa extract - which undergoes an alkalizing process known as ""Dutching"" to remove its acidity - did not have any beneficial effect against the formation of Aβ oligomers and synaptic damage, according to the researchers. This could be because the Dutching process reduces polyphenol levels.

""Our finding of protection against synaptic deficits by lavado cocoa extract, but not Dutched cocoa extract, strongly suggests that polyphenols are the active component that rescue synaptic transmission, since much of the polyphenol content is lost by the high alkalinity in the Dutching process,"" says Dr. Pasinetti.

Dr. Pasinetti says that the loss of synaptic function in the brains of Alzheimer's patients may be more likely to lead to memory loss than the loss of nerve cells, therefore reducing damage to the synapses could be a more reliable target for the development of drugs for Alzheimer's.

This study, according to the researchers, suggests that lavado cocoa extract could pave the way for such drugs, but further studies are needed to better determine how the extract works in the brain.

Furthermore, the team says it could be worth turning lavado cocoa extract into a dietary supplement, as it may provide a ""safe, inexpensive and easily accessible"" way to prevent  Alzheimer's disease.

This is not the first time cocoa has been associated with brain health. Last year, Medical News Today reported on a study by researchers at Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA, which suggested that drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day may prevent memory decline in older adults.

And cocoa has been linked to other health benefits. A recent study published in The FASEB Journal found that dark chocolate may be good for the heart, while other research suggested chocolate may even prevent obesity and diabetes.

Serving free breakfast in New York City's classrooms has boosted the number of students eating what some consider the most important meal of the day at school, according to research by New York University's Institute for Education and Social Policy and the Center for Policy Research at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs.

The study, published in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, finds that this increase in school breakfast participation did not raise the prevalence of obesity in New York City schools, as some critics may have feared. At the same time, breakfast in the classroom did not appear to improve students' attendance or academic achievement.

The School Breakfast Program, a federal program subsidizing school breakfasts for ""nutritionally needy"" children, celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. Like school lunch programs, school breakfasts aim to reduce food insecurity, improve nutrition, and facilitate learning.

Traditionally, breakfast programs take place in school cafeterias before classes begin, but many districts across the country have adopted a different approach by serving breakfast in classrooms at the start of the school day.

""Moving breakfast into the classroom is intended to encourage participation in school breakfast programs, particularly among students unable to arrive early, and to reduce the stigma associated with a trip to the cafeteria,"" said Amy Ellen Schwartz, director of the NYU Institute for Education and Social Policy and Daniel Patrick Moynihan Chair in Public Affairs at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs.

New York City has offered free breakfast to all students since 2003, and began implementing breakfast in the classroom in 2007. As of 2016, breakfast in the classroom is offered in nearly 400 of the city's 1,800 public schools, with more than 30,000 classroom breakfasts served each day. According to the New York City Department of Education, since the implementation of breakfast in the classroom, the participation rate has increased from 25 percent to 80 percent.

Advocates argue that moving breakfast from the cafeteria to the classroom provides many benefits, including improving academic performance, attendance, and engagement, and reducing hunger and food insecurity. Others have raised concerns that breakfast in the classroom can contribute to weight gain and obesity, as some students may consume extra calories by eating two breakfasts -- one at home and one at school.

Using data from the New York City Department of Education and its Office of School Food, the NYU researchers studied students in kindergarten through eighth grade at roughly 200 public elementary and middle schools offering breakfast in some or all classrooms. They examined school breakfast and lunch participation, student height and weight measurements, and administrative data including demographics, attendance, and math and reading test scores in grades 4 through 8.

The researchers observed a substantial increase in school breakfast participation when breakfast was served in the classroom, with no impact on lunch program participation. Despite this increase in breakfasts served, the researchers saw no evidence that the breakfast program contributes to obesity.

In contrast to previous studies finding an academic benefit to breakfast in the classroom, the researchers found that the effects on academic achievement were small and statistically insignificant. At the same time, breakfast in the classroom did not hurt students academically by taking time away from instruction.

Serving breakfast in the classroom had no effect on attendance, which the researchers suggest may be because attendance rates are already high in elementary and middle schools.

""While we find that providing breakfast in the classroom had large positive effects on participation in school breakfast programs, our analysis provides no evidence of hoped-for gains in academic performance, nor of feared increases in obesity,"" said Sean Corcoran, associate director of the NYU Institute for Education and Social Policy and associate professor of educational economics at NYU's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development.

""When looking at academic achievement and attendance, there are few added benefits of having breakfast in the classroom beyond those already provided by free breakfast,"" added Corcoran. ""The policy case for breakfast in the classroom will depend upon reductions in hunger and food insecurity for disadvantaged children, or its longer-term effects.""

These problems include weight gain, increased cholesterol levels, and insulin resistance.

From there, it is a short walk to obesity and type 2 diabetes.

As researchers delve into the science behind these changes, a number of specific pathways have been found to be important.

An intricate web of chemical players conspire to generate the metabolic disorders caused by a high-fat diet. Some of the most important molecules and pathways include:


Over recent years, fish oil has been heralded as a panacea for all ills; claims have been made regarding its ability to induce weight loss, increase fertility, improve skin health, and increase energy. Not all of its claims are backed by rigorous research, but its ability to modify metabolic pathways is gaining more evidence.

Fish oil is high in long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid; these have long been known to improve insulin sensitivity and to have potent anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic (lipid-lowering), and body weight reducing effects.

A team of researchers from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, set out to investigate how fish oil supplementation might influence the metabolism of mice fed on a high-fat diet.

The researchers fed mice fish oil supplements for 4 weeks before starting them on a diet that included high levels of both fat and fish oil.

Once the diet was completed, they collected and analyzed body fat samples from the mice. The samples were compared with fat samples from mice that had received a high-fat diet but no fish oil.

The team measured a number of factors that have an influence over metabolism, such as insulin resistance and fat deposits from different parts of the body.

As expected, the high-fat diet caused significant changes in a number of pathways; these included glucose uptake and secretion of adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, lipolysis, de novo lipogenesis, and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

This range of metabolic alterations, however, did not arise in the mice that received the fish oil supplementation. In other words, negative metabolic effects produced by high-fat intake were halted by fish oil.

The team was led by Prof. Maria Isabel Alonso-Vale, an assistant professor in the Department of Biological Sciences.
""'Our research suggests that fish oil supplements may be used in addition to other strategies as a preventative measure for insulin resistance and obesity.""Prof. Maria Isabel Alonso-Vale, lead investigator
The current study was carried out on a mouse model; as such, before the theory can be confirmed, it must be tested on human subjects. As Prof. Alonso-Vale continues: ""More research will need to be done so we can have a better understanding of the effect of fish oil in humans.""

The findings are intriguing and will, no doubt, attract follow-up investigations. Effective pharmacological interventions for metabolic disorders using fish oil extracts could be just around the corner.

Studying mice with  skin cancer , researchers at the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC) and EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne) have identified a three-way signaling pathway directly involved in  tumor  development. Their research, published in the August, 2006 issue of Genes and Development, pins down a process that could potentially be manipulated to inhibit the growth of existing carcinomas.
   
Genetic mutations in our cells accumulate as we age, and carcinomas are associated with alterations in certain key genes, known as tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. The overexpression of oncogenes disrupts complex cellular signaling pathways and leads to tumor development. However, most oncogenes also play a variety of essential roles in the normal function of a cell. It is extremely difficult to pinpoint the interplay of genetic and cellular events that goes awry when a cell becomes cancerous.
   
To better understand the intertwined roles of three genes known to be implicated in skin cancer, Professor Andreas Trumpp and PhD student Thordur Oskarsson studied mice that carried a mutated form of one of them, the oncogene Ras. They then genetically engineered mice whose skin cells also lacked another oncogene, c-myc. The c-myc gene is known to be a master regulator in the cell, responsible for controlling several hundred other genes.
   
Their first surprise was that the mice without the c-myc gene in their skin cells didn't suffer any adverse effects. Unexpectedly, epidermal cells do not require c-myc for survival, normal differentiation or cellular division. However, even more surprising was that these same mice were completely resistant to developing skin cancer, even though they carried the mutated Ras gene, known to drive tumor development. As expected, mice in the control group carrying a normal copy of the c-myc gene developed  cancer .
   
A piece of the puzzle was clearly missing. The researchers found this in a tumor-suppressing gene known as p21. Mutated Ras drastically increases the level of p21 in the cell, and in this way the tumor-causing effects of Ras are held in check, because p21 inhibits uncontrolled proliferation. However, mutated Ras is a vicious oncogene and has found a way to remove the tumor-suppressing effect of p21. It does this by simultaneously driving increased c-myc activity, which in turn eliminates p21. Thus, epidermis with mutated Ras but no c-myc cannot form tumors as p21 remains highly expressed. Trumpp and his colleagues proved the newly uncovered relationship of this cancer threesome by engineering mice lacking both the c-myc and the p21 genes. As predicted, these mice became sensitive to mutated Ras again and developed extensive skin tumors.
   
""This work is in vivo proof-of-concept of a key pathway in epithelial tumors,"" remarks Trumpp. ""The gene that is truly critical and protects the cells from oncogenic activity is p21. Inhibiting the c-myc pathway was always thought to be unreasonable because this gene is thought to be implicated in so many cellular functions. However, this might prove to be promising avenue for treating existing carcinomas, because it would only affect tumors and not normal skin cells.""

Depression and  anxiety  disorders during childhood may be associated with a higher body mass index ( BMI ) into adulthood for women but not men, according to a study in the March issue of Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, one of the JAMA/Archives journals.
   
The increasing prevalence of  obesity  among children and adults is becoming a public health crisis, according to background information in the article. Understanding the social and psychological conditions that are associated with obesity could help predict which children and adolescents are likely to become obese adults, helping physicians target treatment and prevention efforts. Previous evidence suggests that psychological disorders may be one factor associated with weight gain, but studies in the area have been limited, the authors report.
   
Sarah E. Anderson, M.S., Tufts University, Boston, and colleagues evaluated the association between anxiety disorders and  depression  and weight gain from childhood into adulthood. They analyzed existing data from 820 individuals (403 women and 417 men) from two counties in New York, who were assessed four times between 1983 and 2003. The participants ranged in age from 9 to 18 years at the beginning of the study, and were 28 to 40 years old at the most recent assessment. At each assessment, the researchers interviewed the individuals to determine whether they met clinical criteria for anxiety disorders or depression. The authors calculated BMI-for-age (BMI z scores) by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters and adjusting it for age and gender based on national reference data. BMI z scores correspond to growth chart percentiles and allow for tracking a child's relative weight through adolescence.
   
During the study, 310 participants (119 men and 191 women) had anxiety disorders and 148 (50 men and 98 women) were depressed. Women with anxiety disorders had significantly higher BMI z scores than women of the same age and socioeconomic status without the condition. Women with a history of depression were heavier and experienced a greater yearly increase in their BMI z scores than women without depression. Women who were younger when they developed depression had higher weights in adulthood than women who developed depression later.
   
In women, anxiety disorders were associated with higher weight, with average BMI z scores of .13 to .18 units higher than women without anxiety disorders. For example, an adult woman with history of an anxiety disorder who had an average height (64 inches) would weigh between 6 to 12 pounds more than a woman without anxiety. ""Although these average weight differences are not large, obesity results from incremental increases in weight, and successful prevention is likely to require interventions targeted toward many factors, no one of which, alone, is sufficient to prevent obesity,"" the authors write. An average-height woman diagnosed with depression at age 14 would weigh about 10 to 16 pounds more than a non-depressed woman by the time both reached age 30 years.
   
Depression during childhood was associated with an initially lower BMI among boys, but over time, the weight difference in depressed and non-depressed men disappeared. Anxiety disorders did not appear to be linked to men's BMIs at any point throughout the study.
   
The authors suggest that treating anxiety and depression in girls and women may be one strategy in the battle against obesity, the authors conclude. ""Our results suggest that efforts to improve  mental health  in populations may also help prevent female obesity; consideration of the potential for psychological antecedents and correlates of obesity could improve prevention and treatment,"" they write.

The plethora of diets on the weight loss market is often confusing. Low-carb diets, in particular, go under numerous names - such as Atkins, South Beach, Paleo, and Ketogenic. So which of these is the best option for weight loss? Are the diets safe, and is there a huge difference in results between them?

The Mayo Clinic in Arizona aimed to review studies that examine low-carb diets, in order to find out if they are safe and effective for weight loss, and cardiovascular and metabolic health. They published the results of their study in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association.

Depending on the diet, the physicians found that the definition of low-carb diet is highly variable. Previous studies have shown low-carb diets as comprising less than 45 percent of daily calories from carbohydrates. However, this figure is not dissimilar to the typical Western diet that has more than 50 percent.

While all of the reviewed diets were based on the idea of carbohydrate restriction, the allowed carbs accounted for anywhere between 4-46 percent of daily calories, which the researchers say ""convolutes the evidence.""

An analysis of 41 trials that evaluated the effects of low-carb diets on weight loss revealed that participants lost between 2.5-9 more pounds than individuals who followed a low-fat diet.

""The best conclusion to draw is that adhering to a short-term low-carb diet appears to be safe and may be associated with weight reduction,"" says Dr. Heather Fields, an internal medicine physician at Mayo Clinic and lead researcher on this study.

""However, that weight loss is small and of questionable clinical significance in comparison to low-fat diets. We encourage patients to eat real food and avoid highly processed foods, especially processed meats, such as bacon, sausage, deli meats, hot dogs, and ham when following any particular diet,"" she adds.

To analyze the potentially harmful effects and safety of low-carb diets, Fields and colleagues looked at research conducted between January 2005 and April 2016. People tend to eat more meat when carbohydrates are restricted, which could increase the risk of death from all causes, including cancer. 

Most of the studies failed to provide the source or quality of proteins and fats consumed in the low-fat diets, making it difficult to draw conclusions linking excessive meat consumption to all-cause mortality and increased cancer risks.

However, the studies did show that compared with other diets, low-carb diets were effective for weight loss without adverse effects on blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol.

""Physicians must keep in mind that the literature is surprisingly limited, considering the popularity of these diets and the claims of health benefits in the public press. Our review found no safety issues identified in the current literature, but patients considering low-carb diets should be advised there is very little data on long-term safety and efficacy,"" Field notes.

Field notes that drawing broad conclusions proved difficult due to various limitations within the research. Some of the studies did not include information on the type of weight lost, such as whether it was fat, muscle, or water. Also, many of the studies relied on participants recalling foods and beverages they had consumed, which can be subject to error.

Dr. Tiffany Lowe-Payne, an osteopathic family physician, points out that several factors can affect a person's success with weight loss, including genetics, personal history, and their ability to stick to the diet. 

""As an osteopathic physician, I tell patients there is no one-size-fits-all approach for health. When you think of what dieters want - and what they need to stay motivated - it is the satisfaction of results. They want to see significant weight loss and fast. For many, a low-carb lifestyle provides the answer they are looking for.""
Dr. Tiffany Lowe-Payne
Dr. Lowe-Payne recognizes that carbohydrates make up a considerable part of many people's diets. She also highlights that after 6 months, weight loss is virtually the same for individuals regardless of whether they are on a low-carb or low-fat diet.

For patients who are trying to lower their blood sugar levels or manage insulin resistance, low-carb diets have been shown to be beneficial, Lowe-Payne concludes.

Some research indicates that even acceptable daily intakes of aspartame, as regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), might make you hungrier and lead to weight gain. 


Other studies in rodents have shown that compared with sugar, sweeteners like saccharin and aspartame causes weight gain instead of weight loss.  


Reasons why this may happen are not entirely clear, but a team of researchers from the Massachusetts General Hospital decided to investigate why aspartame does not promote weight loss.
Their research - published in the journal Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism. - suggests one of aspartame's metabolites may play a role. 


The researchers were led by Dr. Richard Hodin, from the Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Surgery. 


One of the breakdown products of aspartame is phenylalanine, an inhibitor of a gut enzyme called intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) that has been shown to prevent metabolic syndrome in mice. 


Metabolic syndrome is a generic name given to a group symptoms associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity.  


Dr. Hodin and team had conducted previous research where they fed IAP to mice that were on a high-fat diet. They found that IAP can prevent the onset of metabolic syndrome, as well as reduce the symptoms in animals that already had the condition. 


Based on this known relationship between IAP, phenylalanine, and aspartame, researchers hypothesized that consuming aspartame may promote metabolic syndrome because of its inhibition of phenylalanine. 


For the study, researchers added aspartame to diet and regular soda, before measuring IAP activity in mice. 


The scientists used four groups of mice. Two groups were put on a normal diet, with one group receiving drinking water with aspartame and the other just plain water. The other two groups were put on a high-fat diet, with one group getting plain water and the other getting water with aspartame.




The normal-diet group that received aspartame consumed the equivalent of 3 ½ cans of diet soda every day. The group that was on a high-fat diet received aspartame in doses the equivalent to almost two cans of diet soda. 


The mice were monitored for 18 weeks.

Dr. Hodin and team found that IAP activity was reduced when it was added to a drink containing aspartame, but IAP levels remained the same when IAP was added to a drink containing sugar. 

Researchers injected aspartame into the mice's small intestines, where IAP is normally produced. They found this reduced IAP levels.


Researchers also injected saline solution in bowel segments, but IAP activity remained the same.  


At the end of the 18-week period, there was no significant difference between the weights of the two groups that were fed a regular diet. 

However, mice on a high-fat diet that received aspartame gained more weight than mice that did not receive aspartame. 


Mice that received the sweetener also had higher blood sugar than those without aspartame. 


They also had higher levels of the TNF-alpha inflammatory protein in their blood, which is usually associated with metabolic syndrome.


""Sugar substitutes like aspartame are designed to promote weight loss and decrease the incidence of metabolic syndrome, but a number of clinical and epidemiologic studies have suggested that these products don't work very well and may actually make things worse,"" says Dr. Hodin. 

Inside the human body, aspartame is metabolized and broken down into phenylalanine, aspartic acid, and methanol. Phenylalanine and aspartic acid are amino acids that are naturally present in many protein-containing foods.


However, phenylalanine inhibits the production of IAP.


""We think that aspartame might not work because, even as it is substituting for sugar, it blocks the beneficial aspects of IAP,"" Dr. Hodin says.
""People do not really understand why these artificial sweeteners don't work. There has been some evidence that they actually can make you more hungry and may be associated with increased calorie consumption. Our findings regarding aspartame's inhibition of IAP may help explain why the use of aspartame is counterproductive."" 
 Dr. Richard Hodin
While the researchers admit that other contributing factors may play a role, Dr. Hodin emphasizes that the findings ""clearly show that aspartame blocks IAP activity, independent of other effects.""

Professor Cecilie Svanes at the Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Bergen (UiB) has recently discovered three development factors that influence aging of the lungs.

""Having a mother who smoked when she was pregnant with you will affect your lungs in a negative way. The same is the case if you were born during the winter months, or if you experienced a severe respiratory infection at a very young age,"" Cecilie Svanes explains.

Svanes' previous research has shown that early life factors affect the growth and development of the lungs. In her latest research, she has been studying people aged between 40 and 70 years, to find out if conditions in early life also affect the lungs' aging.

""It is logical that early life development also affects the systems that maintain our body and repair damage. If so, this could explain why some people do not tolerate exposure to certain toxics in later life. And that is actually what we found,"" she says.

The discovery has been published in the scientific journal PlosONE, and is one of the findings made in the preparatory stages of the project Aging Lungs in European Cohorts (ALEC), which is in part funded by the EU's Horizon 2020 programme.

People who have been exposed to the aforementioned factors have a faster decline in lung function, which practically means a faster aging process. Still, this only becomes apparent if they themselves start smoking or if other risk factors have been a part of their early life.

""We can put it this way: smoking is dangerous for everyone, but these people are far more vulnerable to its effects. We can also imagine that they would be particularly vulnerable also to other factors, such as air pollution,"" says Svanes.

The new results fit well with Svanes' previous research showing that people with unfavourable early life development are less tolerant towards, for instance, detergents when working as cleaners.

Svanes believes that the discovery of some people being more vulnerable than others can be used in a positive way in preventive health care.

""This way we can concentrate the efforts on those who are the most vulnerable. We have limited resources for prevention, so it is important that the money is spent on those with the highest perceived risk,"" says Svanes.

She believes that such measures could help even out differences among the population. Especially in the most poverty-stricken parts of the world it might be particularly useful to find out where it would be most efficient to take measures for improving public health.

""If you get a 50 year-old to quit smoking, it is beneficial. If you get him/her to stop as a teenager, it is even better. But if the mother refrains from smoking before he/she is conceived, it might play an even bigger role for future overall health,"" Cecilie Svanes concludes.

Svanes now wishes to find out why this is the case.

""We also want to look into the background of these mechanisms, and examine them in a larger population sample.""

Keeping count of daily steps and boosting physical activity can really pay off for children with type 1 diabetes, according to new research from the University of Adelaide and the Women's and Children's Hospital.

For the first time, researchers have shown that children who have type 1 diabetes can improve their cardiovascular health, simply by taking an extra 1000 steps a day.

Researchers tracked the daily physical activity of 90 pre- to early-teenage children with type 1 diabetes.

The results - published online ahead of print in the journal Diabetes Care - show that those who undertook additional physical activity showed improvements in their blood vessel structure, and other reductions in risk factors for heart disease.

""Children with type 1 diabetes often report lower physical activity levels than recommended for children of the same age,"" says lead author Dr Alexia Peña, from the University of Adelaide's Robinson Research Institute and Pediatric Endocrinologist at the Women's and Children's Hospital in Adelaide.

""We also tend to see early signs of atherosclerosis - a build up of plaque in the arteries - and other adverse cardiovascular risks at an earlier age than usual for these children.""

The research team found that 55% of the children took fewer than 10,000 steps per day.

""There were clear correlations between artery thickness and the average number of steps per day. With an increase of 1000 steps each day, we saw a measurable decrease in this arterial thickness,"" Dr Peña says.

""In the children who had extra physical activity, we also saw reductions in weight, blood pressure, and trigylcerides, which indicates an overall reduction in risk of heart disease.""

Dr Peña says this is the first time the daily number of steps has been shown to directly relate to early signs of adverse cardiovascular risk in children with type 1 diabetes.

""Our findings emphasize the importance of physical activity for children, and the need for advice on the benefits of exercise for children with type 1 diabetes. The more steps they do, the better,"" Dr Peña says.

Study co-author Maria Argos, assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), and colleagues recently reported their findings in the journal Epidemiology.

A gluten-free diet excludes foods that contain gluten - a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, as well as the byproducts of these grains.

For people with celiac disease - an autoimmune condition whereby gluten intake leads to intestinal damage - a gluten-free diet is the only treatment for the condition. 

However, according to a 2012 survey, around 28-30 percent of us restrict our gluten intake or avoid consuming the protein completely, even in the absence of gluten sensitivities.

Rice flour is a common substitute for gluten in many gluten-free products. Argos and colleagues point out that rice can bioaccumulate arsenic, mercury, and other potentially harmful toxic metals from water, soil, or fertilizers. 

Exposure to these metals has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other diseases.

""Despite such a dramatic shift in the diet of many Americans, little is known about how gluten-free diets might affect exposure to toxic metals found in certain foods,"" note the authors.

With the aim of investigating the link between gluten-free diets and toxic metal exposure, Argos and team analyzed the data of 7,471 individuals who were a part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2009 and 2014.

The researchers identified 73 participants aged between 6 and 80 who reported following a gluten-free diet.

Blood and urine samples were taken from all participants and assessed for levels of arsenic and mercury.

The researchers found that levels of each toxic metal were much higher among subjects who followed a gluten-free diet than those who did not eat gluten-free products; mercury levels were 70 percent higher in the blood of gluten-free subjects, while arsenic levels in urine were almost twice as high.

According to Argos, these findings suggest that there may be ""unintended consequences of eating a gluten-free diet,"" though further studies are needed to confirm whether this is the case.

The researchers add that:
""With the increasing popularity of gluten-free diets, these findings may have important health implications since the health effects of low-level arsenic and mercury exposure from food sources are uncertain but may increase the risk for cancer and other chronic diseases.

Although we can only speculate, rice may be contributing to the observed higher concentrations of metal biomarkers among those on a gluten-free diet as the primary substitute grain in gluten-free products.""
Argos points out that there are regulations in Europe that limit arsenic levels in food products, and he suggests that the United States might benefit from similar regulations.

""We regulate levels of arsenic in water, but if rice flour consumption increases the risk for exposure to arsenic, it would make sense to regulate the metal in foods as well,"" he adds.

Researchers have shown that the glucose-lowering drug liraglutide safely and effectively decreases the overall risk of heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death for people with type 2 diabetes. These patients are at high risk for cardiovascular disease, which is the number one killer of people with type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide was also associated with a reduction in kidney disease and death from all causes.
 
The paper, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, details findings from a global clinical trial called ""Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results"" or LEADER. This worldwide effort of 700 institutions in 32 countries marks the first time a diabetes drug with the main goal of lowering blood sugar has demonstrated such broad benefits for patients.
  
""I've been excited about liraglutide for a long time because I think it's unique,"" said John Buse, MD, PhD, senior author of the study, director of the UNC Diabetes Care Center, and the Verne S. Caviness Distinguished Professor of Medicine at the UNC School of Medicine. ""This is the first diabetes drug that has shown across-the-board benefits for cardiovascular diseases, and this suggests it plays a role in treating atherosclerosis, which is what leads to heart attacks and strokes.""
  
The LEADER study was a randomized double-blind study of 9,340 adults with type 2 diabetes who were at high risk of heart disease. About half of the participants were given liraglutide, and half were in the placebo group. Placebo, in this case, meant that patients could take other diabetes medications to control their blood sugar. Both groups of patients were prescribed medications to address associated health problems, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
  
The trial lasted more than three years. In the end, liraglutide was associated with:

""This changes the whole conversation about treating diabetes,"" Buse said. ""To date, people have taken diabetes drugs to lower blood sugar. Now we can say that they should take liraglutide to prevent or delay the worst things that occur commonly in diabetes - heart attacks, strokes, advanced kidney disease, and death.""
 
Last year, researchers reported that another diabetes drug, empagliflozin, reduced death from cardiovascular events, but some of the data from that major clinical trial were unclear. Empagliflozin only showed a marginal effect on lowering heart attack risk and no benefit on limiting strokes. The drug is a SGLT-2 inhibitor; it works in the kidneys to help the body get rid of glucose.
 
Liraglutide is a GLP-1 agonist; it works in the pancreas to stimulate insulin secretion and reduce the production of an anti-insulin hormone - known as glucagon - which raises the concentration of blood glucose. Liraglutide also works in the brain to reduce appetite and increase satiety - the sensation of feeling full.
 
""The next big question,"" Buse said, ""is can we combine these two drugs to help patients with advanced type 2 diabetes who are at severe risk of cardiovascular complications?""
 
Type 2 Diabetes affects more than 370 million people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. In the United States, more than 29 million people have the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
 
People with diabetes try to control their blood sugar with increased exercise, dietary changes, and typically the first-line medication metformin. If this regimen does not work well enough, then doctors and patients can add one of the six second-line therapies, including liraglutide, which the Food and Drug Administration approved for use in the United States in December 2014.
 
Last year, Buse reported news from a clinical study showing that a combination of two second-line type 2 diabetes drugs - degludec and liraglutide - was better at managing blood sugar than were traditional basal insulin shots.
 
""As more medications to treat type 2 diabetes come on the market, these sorts of clinical trials are invaluable measures of a drug's true benefit or lack thereof,"" Buse said. ""Right now, liraglutide is clearly showing it is one of the best second-line therapies available. Yet, it would be best if we could reduce the burden of this disease with preventive measures, which is why early screening and interventions remain incredibly important.""

Black Americans often have lower survival rates for  cancer  even for the same stage at discovery and same type of treatment.  A study published in the March issue of the Journal of the National Medical Association (JNMA) suggests that one of the reasons for this difference is that Black Americans have lower levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] than white Americans due to lower amounts of  vitamin D  from all sources.  Black Americans have about 40 to 60% of the serum 25(OH)D levels of white Americans.    
 Vitamin  D has been found to reduce the risk of developing breast, colorectal, ovarian, and  prostate cancer  and/or non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  and increasing the survival rates of these cancers as well as  lung cancer ,  melanoma , and/or Hodgkin’s lymphoma in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, and the U.S.  Solar UVB, an important source of vitamin D, has also been found associated with reduced risk of mortality for another dozen types of cancer for white Americans.    

In the study published in the JNMA, it was found that summertime solar UVB doses were inversely associated with colon, esophageal, gastric, lung, and rectal cancer for Black American males, but just breast and  gastric cancer  for Black females.  Lung cancer mortality rates, used in this ecologic study as the index for the adverse health effects of smoking, were highly correlated with these cancers (other than gastric cancer) as well as  ovarian cancer , so the associations found in this study may not be solely due to smoking.  However, lung cancer mortality rates are also linked to dietary fat, genetics, and vitamin D.  Black women generally have lower serum 25(OH)D levels than Black men, which may have affected the findings.    

A recent meta-analyses of  colorectal cancer  risk with respect to oral vitamin D intake and serum 25(OH)D found that about 1000 I.U. of vitamin D per day reduces the risk of colorectal cancer incidence by 50%.  Black Americans have been found to have about one-third to one-half the serum levels of serum 25(OH)D corresponding to these reductions in cancer risk on average, while white Americans have about one-half to two-thirds of such levels on average.    

Since Black Americans have darker skin, it takes them 2-4 times as long in solar UVB to make the same amount of vitamin D as white Americans do.  The easiest way for Black Americans to increase serum 25(OH)D levels would be through supplements, with 1000 to 2000 I.U. per day recommended.  Increasing vitamin D intake and serum 25(OH)D levels to these levels by Black and white Americans would likely reduce overall cancer incidence rates by 30% for Black Americans and 10% for white Americans and increase cancer survival rates by 20-30%.

Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, March, 2006 – Results from a new study show that Aldara (imiquimod) Cream, 5%, a topical  skin cancer  treatment, improved the structure and appearance of prematurely aged skin, including fine lines, wrinkles, dyspigmentations and texture. The findings, from researchers at S.K.I.N. Incorporated, a dermatology research facility, are presented as a poster this weekend at the 64th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology in San Francisco.
   
Aldara Cream is an immune response modifier used to treat precancerous skin lesions called actinic keratoses (AK) as well as superficial basal cell  carcinoma  (sBCC), a nonmelanoma skin cancer. It works by stimulating the body's immune system. AK and sBCC are the result of a lifetime of exposure to ultraviolet rays of the sun. Long-term exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun can also cause structural and cosmetic damage to the skin commonly referred to as photodamage. Photodamaged skin is characterized by fine lines and wrinkles, roughness, dryness, lack of firmness and irregular pigmentation.
   
""Our results indicate that Aldara Cream may offer patients cosmetic benefits in addition to its important therapeutic role in treating precancerous and cancerous skin lesions,"" said Albert Kligman, MD, PhD, Professor Emeritus of Dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania and lead investigator in this study. ""We initiated this study after anecdotal finding that some AK patients treated with Aldara Cream reported cosmetic improvements to their skin. Further exploration of the cosmetic uses for Aldara Cream is clearly warranted.""
   
The open-label study included ten healthy females with visible signs of photoaging. Volunteers received Aldara Cream five times per week for four weeks. At predetermined intervals, the subjects were evaluated for both visible and microscopic-level changes to the underlying skin structures.
   
According to the results of this small study, treatment with Aldara Cream corrected the structural changes associated with photodamage caused by sun exposure. Additionally, use of Aldara visibly reduced fine lines and wrinkles, improved skin texture and resulted in more uniform skin color. At the end of the study, 80 percent of the subjects rated these improvements as ""moderate"" or ""great."" According to subjects' assessments, 90 percent expressed strong approval of the cosmetic benefits. The visible improvement in appearance was also documented by histological study of biopsies. Aldara Cream was well tolerated in the study and no volunteers reported irritation with redness, stinging, or discomfort.

""Previous studies have found that a person's lutein status is linked to cognitive performance across the lifespan,"" Zamroziewicz said. ""Research also shows that lutein accumulates in the gray matter of brain regions known to underlie the preservation of cognitive function in healthy brain aging.""

The study enrolled 122 healthy participants aged 65 to 75 who solved problems and answered questions on a standard test of crystallized intelligence. Researchers also collected blood samples to determine blood serum levels of lutein and imaged participants' brains using MRI to measure the volume of different brain structures.

The team focused on parts of the temporal cortex, a brain region that other studies suggest plays a role in the preservation of crystallized intelligence.

The researchers found that participants with higher blood serum levels of lutein tended to do better on tests of crystallized intelligence. Serum lutein levels reflect only recent dietary intakes, Zamroziewicz said, but are associated with brain concentrations of lutein in older adults, which reflect long-term dietary intake.

Those with higher serum lutein levels also tended to have thicker gray matter in the parahippocampal cortex, a brain region that, like crystallized intelligence, is preserved in healthy aging, the researchers report.

""Our analyses revealed that gray-matter volume of the parahippocampal cortex on the right side of the brain accounts for the relationship between lutein and crystallized intelligence,"" Barbey said. ""This offers the first clue as to which brain regions specifically play a role in the preservation of crystallized intelligence, and how factors such as diet may contribute to that relationship.""

""Our findings do not demonstrate causality,"" Zamroziewicz said. ""We did find that lutein is linked to crystallized intelligence through the parahippocampal cortex.""

""We can only hypothesize at this point how lutein in the diet affects brain structure,"" Barbey said. ""It may be that it plays an anti-inflammatory role or aids in cell-to-cell signaling. But our finding adds to the evidence suggesting that particular nutrients slow age-related declines in cognition by influencing specific features of brain aging.""

Malnourished children are most likely to die from common infections, not starvation alone, and immune disorder may be part of the cause, according to a review led by Queen Mary University of London.
 
The paper, published in Trends in Immunology, also indicates that even with a healthy diet, defects in immune system function from birth could contribute to a malnourished state throughout life. These altered immune systems could be passed down from generation to generation regardless of the diet of any offspring.
 
Researchers speculate that targeting immune pathways could be a new approach to reduce the poor health and mortality caused by under- and overnutrition.
 
First author Claire Bourke, from the Centre for Genomics and Child Health at Queen Mary University of London, said: ""That traditional image of malnutrition that we're unfortunately so familiar with - of someone wasting away - that's just the external picture. Those height and weight defects that we see are the tip of the iceberg - there are a whole range of pro-inflammatory conditions, impaired gut function, weakened responses to new infections, and a resulting high metabolic burden underlying them.""
 
The most common form of undernutrition globally is stunting - where children fail to achieve their full height potential. Despite looking healthy, children in developing countries who are stunted in height may also have stunted immune development, making them more vulnerable to death by common infections.
 
Much of the previous data on the role of the immune system in malnutrition is outdated and only recently have researchers had access to technology that can accurately study immunodeficiency in this context. How malnutrition and immune function are related is still poorly understood, however, there is wide acceptance that malnutrition comes with a range of immune problems. These include reduced numbers of white blood cells, skin and gut membranes that are easier for pathogens to break through, and malfunctioning lymph nodes.
 
Immune dysfunction results from consumption of too few calories because of lack of food, an inability to absorb nutrients effectively, or an excess of fat and sugar in the diet. If malnourished people have offspring, their children can also inherit an altered immune system (even after multiple generations), because that dysfunction is recorded in the DNA through epigenetic marks. This altered immune system may then cause malnutrition even if children have an adequate diet. 
 
Claire Bourke adds: ""There are new models for environmental enteric dysfunction in mice, a growing interest in microbiota and epigenetics - all of these studies show that the more we look into the immune system, the more it has a role to play in a really wide array of physiological systems. It doesn't just fight infection; it affects metabolism, neurological function, and growth, which are things that are also impaired in malnutrition.""
 
Bourke imagines a future where clinicians could generate individualised immune readouts that can identify young people most susceptible to infection as a result of malnutrition. This could reduce the burden of a leading cause of child mortality by helping those who are most vulnerable get treated more often and sooner with targeted interventions.

The Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) in an opinion report to the European Commission said that devices used to achieve and maintain cosmetic tanning, such as tanning lamps and sunbeds, may significantly increase a user's risk of malignant  melanoma  of the skin.    

It warns high risk people, such as those with freckles, atypical and/or multiple moles, those with a family history of melanoma, and people whose skin is highly susceptible to  sunburn , should never use these tanning devices for cosmetic purposes.    

As tanning devices are more dangerous for younger people, the EU commission also advises people under 18 not to use them.  In order to prevent misuse, the Commission calls on Member Governments and manufacturers of sunbeds and tanning lamps to make sure their devices have clear warnings and instructions.    

Standards authorities should introduce UV limits in products and introduce a guidance for the industry and consumers.  Solariums should apply these recommendations   

Commission Vice-President G�nter Verheugen, responsible for enterprise and industry policy, said ""The Commission calls upon Member States and the sun-bed industry to ensure that appropriate warnings and instructions are provided with sun-beds in order to reduce the risks of users developing related  skin cancer . We call on Member States and industry to ensure an appropriate use of sun beds.""    

Commissioner Markos Kyprianou, responsible for health and consumer protection policy, has declared ""I am concerned that indiscriminate use of these tanning devices for cosmetic purposes could lead to an increased incidence of skin-  cancers . We need to act rapidly in order to raise public awareness of the risks associated with sunbeds. We also need guidance to consumers to help them recognise whether they have risk factors and should not use these devices. I will propose initiatives in that respect without delay"".    
 What will the Commission do?   

The Commission will look at the report by the SCCP and see what measures could be taken, both legislative and non-legislative.  As a first priority, the Commission aims to inform consumers about the recommendations of the report through consumer organisations and Member State authorities.  A guidance fiche will be prepared by the Commission in all official EU languages - this will be done in cooperation with the European Dermatologists Association.    

The relevant standard - EN 60335-2-27:1997 - should be amended.  The standard should take into account the recommendations made, including those concerning irradiance.

Lead study author Dr. Katia Jedeon, of the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM), and colleagues found exposure to the chemicals bisphenol A (BPA) and vinclozolin may interfere with hormones responsible for the growth of dental enamel.

The researchers recently presented their findings at the 2016 European Congress of Endocrinology in Munich, Germany.

BPA and vinclozolin have been identified as endocrine disruptors (EDs) in numerous studies. This means they can interfere with hormone functioning in mammals, increasing the risk of reproductive problems, cancer, births defects, and various other conditions.

BPA is used in the production of certain plastics and resins, many of which are used for food and drink packaging, while vinclozolin is a fungicide used to protect vineyards, orchards, and golf courses.

Dr. Jedeon and colleagues note that previous animal studies have indicated that EDs may be related to a condition called molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH), which is estimated to affect up to 18 percent of children aged 6-9 years.

MIH is a developmental condition in which enamel defects occur in the first permanent teeth, most commonly the molars and incisors. Such a defect is irreversible; once tooth enamel is damaged, it cannot grow back.

Children with MIH can experience heightened tooth sensitivity, particularly to cold foods and drinks, and they are at greater risk for dental caries. Their teeth may be creamy, yellow, or brown in appearance, and they may chip away easily.

For their study, Dr. Jedeon and colleagues conducted two experiments to gain a better understanding of how exposure to EDs might be associated with MIH.

Firstly, the team exposed rats to daily doses of either BPA alone or a combination of BPA and vinclozolin from birth for 30 days. Doses were equivalent to the average daily dose a human would be exposed to.

At the end of the 30 days, the researchers collected cells from the surface of the rats' teeth.

On analyzing the cells, they found that exposure to BPA and vinclozolin altered the expression of two genes - KLK4 and SLC5A8 - that regulate tooth enamel mineralization.

Next, the researchers cultured ameloblast cells of rats, which are cells that deposit enamel during tooth development. They found that these cells contain sex hormones - including estrogen and testosterone - that increase the expression of genes that produce tooth enamel.

Interestingly, they found that testosterone increases the expression of the KLK4 and SLC5A8 genes.

Because both BPA and vinclozolin are known to inhibit the effect of male sex hormones, the authors say their findings indicate that the chemicals may lead to MIH by blocking hormones needed for development of tooth enamel.
""Tooth enamel starts at the third trimester of pregnancy and ends at the age of 5, so minimizing exposure to endocrine disruptors at this stage in life as a precautionary measure would be one way of reducing the risk of enamel weakening.""Dr. Katia Jedeon

Office workers can stave off health problems associated with sitting down all day by regularly exercising, a new study has found.
 
Being physically active may offset some of the deleterious consequences of spending large amounts of time not being active, the paper published in BMC Public Health has revealed.
 
The study further emphasises the importance of physical activity in the promotion and maintenance of health.
 
In contrast, people described as 'couch potatoes' are putting their health at risk by spending too much time sat down and not exercising, the paper said. Low sedentary (sitting) time in the absence of physical activity is associated with higher HDL (good) cholesterol levels.
 
Sedentary behaviour is defined as habitual sitting time. Higher levels of sedentary behaviour are associated with worse health, whereas higher levels of physical activity are associated with better health. However, the extent to which the combination of these behaviours influence health is less well-known.
 
The aim of this study was to examine the associations of four categories of physical activity and sedentary time compared with markers of diabetes and heart disease.
 
The researchers used data from the 2008 Health Survey to paint a nationally representative sample of English adults.
 
They grouped people into the following categories, including the physically active (those meeting the recommended guidelines for physical activity) and low sedentary 'busy bees', the physically active and high sedentary 'sedentary exercisers', the physically inactive (those not meeting the recommended guidelines for physical activity) and low sedentary 'light movers' and physically inactive and high sedentary 'couch potatoes'.
 
Lead researcher Dr Thomas Yates, from the Leicester Diabetes Centre and the University of Leicester, concluded: ""We demonstrate that in comparison to adults who are physically inactive with high sedentary time, those who are physically active have a more desirable health profile across multiple cardiometabolic markers even when combined with high sedentary time. In contrast, low sedentary time in the absence of physical activity is associated with higher HDL-cholesterol levels.
 
""By suggesting that being physically active may offset some of the deleterious consequences of routinely engaging in high levels of sedentary behaviour, this study further emphasises the importance of physical activity in the promotion and maintenance of health.
 
""However, given the observational design, the relative magnitude of effect of physical activity and sedentary behaviour on health needs further examination through experimental or intervention level research.""
 
University of Leicester researcher Kishan Bakrania, who also worked on the study, added: ""This research is significant because it demonstrates yet again why physical activity and exercise is so important. It shows that people who spend large amounts of time not moving either through work, leisure or lifestyle can counteract some of the negative effects of sedentary behaviour by regularly exercising.""

A girl in her teens who is obese has a much greater chance of dying during middle age than a teenage girl of normal weight, according to researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health.  With childhood  obesity  in many parts of the world on the increase, in years to come we could see life-expectancy coming down.    

In much of the developed world, and some parts of the developing world, teenage obesity is growing at an alarming rate.  In the USA 15.5% of teenagers are overweight.    

The study, carried out by Dr. Frank Hu, and team, is published in  The Annals of Internal Medicine .  Dr. Hu said the study underscores the importance of childhood obesity.  He stressed that childhood obesity not only affects the health of children, it is also a significant contributory factor towards death in adulthood.    

Dr. Hu said ""The link between childhood obesity and premature death is an important public-health issue.  Prevention at early ages is an important strategy to combat this problem.""    

This study looked at 102,400 women in the Nurses Health Study 2.  At the start of the study period, the women were aged 24-44.  They had all filled a questionnaire which included their weight when they were 18.  They were followed up for 12 years.  During these 12 years 710 of them died.    

The researchers found that those who were obese at 18 were three times as likely to die at middle age compared to those who were of normal weight at 18.  This was after adjustments had been made for such factors as cigarette smoking, alcohol use and physical activity during adolescence.

Created using information from sources including the UK's National Health Service (NHS), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and energy drink manufacturer Red Bull, the infographic follows another that went viral earlier this month, revealing how Coca-Cola affects the body within 1 hour of drinking it.

This new infographic, however, details what an energy drink - namely, a can of Red Bull - does to the body over a 24-hour period.

Energy drinks are marketed as beverages that boost mental and physical performance. Caffeine is the most common stimulant in these drinks, but some brands contain other plant-based stimulants, such as guarana and ginseng.

According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the amount of caffeine in a can or bottle of energy drink can range from 80 mg to over 500 mg. For comparison, one 5-ounce cup of coffee contains around 100 mg of caffeine.

Like soda, energy drinks are also high in sugar. A 250 ml can of Red Bull, for example, contains around 27.5 g of sugar.

Numerous studies have suggested energy drinks can have negative health implications. A 2013 study reported by Medical News Today, for example, found energy drinks alter the heart function of healthy adults, while another study linked energy drink consumption to other unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking.

But what exactly do energy drinks do to the body after we consume them?

According to the infographic, caffeine enters the bloodstream within 10 minutes of consuming an energy drink, triggering a rise in heart rate and blood pressure

Over the next 15-45 minutes, caffeine levels in the bloodstream peak. As a result, an individual will feel more alert and experience improved concentration.

""Caffeine is a crafty drug that temporarily blocks adenosine [a chemical involved in how tired we feel] pathways, giving you a boost while allowing 'feel good' molecules in the brain - such as dopamine - to be released more readily. You feel more alert and you feel better about yourself,"" science communicator and food researcher Dr. Stuart Farrimond told The Daily Mail.

All of the caffeine is absorbed within 30-50 minutes of consuming an energy drink, according to the infographic, and the liver responds to this by soaking up more sugar into the bloodstream.

Within an hour, the effects of the caffeine will begin to subside and a sugar crash may occur. Energy levels will begin to feel low and tiredness will set in.

It will take around 5-6 hours for the body to achieve a 50% reduction in the amount of caffeine in the bloodstream - known as the ""half-life"" - and it is likely to take double this amount of time for women on birth control pills. It takes an average of 12 hours for the body to completely remove the caffeine from the bloodstream, though this does depend on individual factors.

""Pregnancy, liver damage and other drugs can also slow the rate at which caffeine is eliminated from the body,"" Dr. Farrimond told The Daily Mail. ""Importantly, children and teenagers have a significantly longer half-life, meaning caffeine will remain in their bloodstream for longer and at higher levels than for adults. This is why caffeinated drinks can cause behavioral problems and anxiety issues in children.""

The infographic claims that individuals who consume energy drinks regularly may experience caffeine withdrawal in the 12-24 hours after consumption, which includes symptoms such as headache, irritability and constipation.

Dr. Farrimond explained that withdrawal symptoms can last up to 9 days and the severity depends on the amount of caffeine consumed.

For regular energy drink consumers, it takes around 7-12 days for the body to adapt to a regular intake of caffeine, according to the infographic. An individual is unlikely to experience a boost from the beverages once their body gets used to them.

While the information provided in this infographic is not new, it does help shed light on why so many studies have cited the health implications of energy drinks. 

Still, energy drink consumption is rising, In the US, sales of the beverages increased by 60% between 2008 and 2012.

Energy drinks are particularly popular with children and adolescents. Last year, Medical News Today reported on a study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which found that 73% of children consume caffeine on a daily basis - much of which is coming from energy drinks and coffee.

A novel vaccine has significantly increased life expectancy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most dangerous type of brain  tumor , a researcher from The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center is reporting at the annual meeting of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS).
   
Median survival for the 23 patients tested at M. D. Anderson and at Duke University Medical Center is at least 19 months, and only four patients have died from the  cancer , says Amy Heimberger, M.D., an assistant professor of Neurosurgery at M. D. Anderson. That figure surpasses the median survival of 14 months for patients with GBM who are treated with the most current  chemotherapy  and radiation, and the 4-month median survival for untreated patients, she says.
   
""We can't say this vaccine is better than chemotherapy because we haven't tested the two treatments head-to-head yet,"" she says. ""However, so far, results have exceeded the expectations we had for this vaccine.""
   
Heimberger's study was chosen by AANS for a Young Investigator's Award, and is being cited as one of the conference's most important findings.
   
The trial is now closed at both institutions. Given its statistically significant findings, a pharmaceutical company has acquired the rights to the drug and a larger, multi-institutional, randomized study is being planned, Heimberger says.
   
She describes the vaccine as an easy to use ""off-the-shelf"" treatment that can potentially help up to 50 percent of all GBM patients keep their cancer at bay for a period of time. Interim results of the Phase II clinical trial show that the vaccine significantly delays progression of tumors until the cancer finds a new growth pathway.
   
""This is a proof of concept, and optimal use of the vaccine may be with chemotherapy to further retard progression,"" says Heimberger. ""Still, this is exciting to us because people have been trying to use immunotherapy against gliomas for a long time.""
   
Heimberger and a team of researchers designed the vaccine to alert the brain's immune system to the presence of just one type of protein that studs the outside of a glioma tumor. This protein, epidermal growth factor variant III (EGFRvIII), is found on 30 percent to 50 percent of brain tumors, as well as on some breast and non-small-cell  lung cancers , but not on normal tissue. Heimberger believes EGFRvIII drives gliomas to spread, which could explain why these brain tumors are unusually dangerous and invasive.
   
The vaccine contains a synthesized piece of EGFRvIII and compounds that stimulate immune system dendritic cells, which then activate the immune system in general and cytotoxic CD8 cells in particular. ""It tricks the body into thinking that EGFRvIII is foreign, and the CD8 cells are sent in to kill the tumor,"" Heimberger says.
   
After initial therapy - three injections over a two-week period - patients in the clinical trial receive a monthly booster shot designed to keep the immune system activated against EGFRvIII-bearing cells. ""Some patients have had booster shots for more than two years,"" she says. ""We have found that the vaccine activates both the B- and T-cell arms of the immune system, and the vaccine is acting both as a therapy and as a preventive treatment.""
   
When tumors began to grow again in the patients involved in the study, none of them displayed the protein. ""We believe that this means the vaccine did its job,"" Heimberger says.
   
This easily manufactured and administered vaccine differs greatly from previous attempts to vaccinate patients against brain tumors, she adds, because those strategies required harvesting cells from each patient, growing them in the laboratory while manipulating them to express a certain protein, and then infusing them back into patients. ""All we do for this vaccine is make sure the patient's tumor expresses EGFRvIII,"" Heimberger says. ""The same vaccine is used for all patients who have such a tumor.""
   
Heimberger expects that median survival rates will continue to increase over time.

A Mayo Clinic-led study found that obese teenagers have lower levels of a hormone potentially tied to weight management than teens of normal weights. The study is published in the Endocrine Society's Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

""Our study is the first to look at levels of spexin in the pediatric population,"" says Seema Kumar, M.D., Mayo Clinic Children's Center, one of the study's authors. ""Previous research has found reduced levels of this hormone in adults with obesity. Overall, our findings suggest spexin may play a role in weight gain, beginning at an early age.""

For children and teens, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines obesity as having a body mass index (BMI) at or above the 95th percentile for children and teens of the same age and sex.

Obesity affects about 17 percent of U.S. children, according to the Endocrine Society's ""Endocrine Facts and Figures Report."" Childhood obesity is associated with an estimated $14.1 billion in additional prescription drug, emergency department visit and outpatient visit costs each year.

The cross-sectional study analyzed spexin levels in 51 obese and 18 teenagers of normal weights between ages 12 and 18. The participants had blood samples taken between 2008 and 2010 as part of separate clinical trials.

Researchers tested the blood samples to measure spexin levels. Researchers divided the teenagers into four groups based on their spexin levels. Among the participants with the lowest levels of spexin, the odds of having obesity were 5¼ times higher than in the group with the highest levels of the hormone. Unlike what has been noted in adults, there was no association between spexin levels and fasting glucose.

""It is noteworthy that we see such clear differences in spexin levels between obese and normal weight adolescents,"" Kumar says. ""Since this is a cross-sectional study, more research is needed to explore the physiological significance of spexin, how it may be involved in the development of childhood obesity, and whether it can be used to treat or manage the condition.""

314,271513,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/313612.php,Diabetes risk doubles with more than two soft drinks daily,Diabetes,Diabetes,Nutrition / Diet,Immune System / Vaccines,,1,1,1,5,4,4,3,2,3,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,,,"
From an analysis of more than 2,800 adults, researchers found that the consumption of at least two 200-milliliter sugary or artificially sweetened soft drinks a day was linked to a twofold greater risk of type 2 diabetes, as well as a form of type 1 diabetes known as latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA).

Lead study author Josefin Edwall Löfvenborg, of the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, and colleagues publish their findings in the European Journal of Endocrinology.

It is estimated that around 29.1 million Americans - around 9.3 percent of the population - have diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the condition, accounting for around 90-95 percent of all cases. This arises when cells in the body are unable to effectively use the hormone insulin - known as insulin resistance - causing blood sugar levels to rise.

Type 1 diabetes accounts for around 5-10 percent of diabetes cases. It is considered an autoimmune disease, where the immune system mistakingly attacks insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to little or no insulin production. 

LADA is a subtype of type 1 diabetes. It is a slow-progressing condition that typically develops later in adulthood, normally between the ages of 30-50 years. 

LADA is sometimes referred to as ""type 1.5"" diabetes, as it shares some characteristics of type 1 and type 2; it is believed to be an autoimmune disease like type 1, but it also incorporates insulin resistance like type 2.

Previous research has demonstrated a link between high consumption of sugary drinks and type 2 diabetes; this effect has primarily been attributed to the weight gain associated with high sugary drink intake.

In this latest study, Löfvenborg and team set out to investigate whether artificially sweetened soft drinks might have the same effect, and whether soft drink intake - both sugary and artificially sweetened - might affect the development of LADA.

The study included 2,874 Swedish adults, of whom 1,136 had type 2 diabetes, 357 had LADA, and 1,137 were healthy controls.

The team analyzed the self-reported dietary data of each adult, looking specifically at the number of soft drinks consumed up to 1 year before a diabetes diagnosis. Participants' insulin resistance levels, beta cell function, and autoimmune response were also measured.

The researchers found that adults who reported drinking at least two 200-milliliter servings of soft drinks a day - whether they contained sugar or artificial sweetener - were twice as likely to develop LADA and 2.4 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, compared with those who consumed fewer than two soft drinks daily.

What is more, adults who consumed five 200-milliliter servings of soft drinks daily were found to be at 3.5 times greater risk of LADA and 10.5 times greater risk of type 2 diabetes, regardless of whether the drinks were sugary or artificially sweetened.

Löfvenborg told Medical News Today that she was ""somewhat surprised"" that artificially sweetened drinks were associated with increased diabetes risk, but she said there are a number of possible explanations.

""One is that consumption of diet soft drinks may stimulate appetite and make us increase our food intake, especially sweet/sugary foods, possibly leading to overweight, which is a risk factor for diabetes,"" she told us. ""Another one is that artificial sweeteners may negatively affect the balance of 'good' and 'bad' species of microbes in the gut, which could lead to glucose intolerance.""

""But even though there are suggested mechanisms that are plausible,"" she added, ""I would like to point out that one other explanation to our findings for artificially sweetened beverages may be that some people have swapped from sugary to diet soft drinks in an attempt to prevent further weight gain/to lose weight.""

""If that would be the case, it would mean that we are assessing the effect of previous intake of sugary drinks rather than the effect of diet soft drinks,"" she said.

While the researchers expected to see an increased risk of type 2 diabetes with soft drink consumption, they were surprised to find soft drink intake may also raise the risk of LADA, given it is an autoimmune condition.

""We next plan on investigating what could counter this risk, such as eating fatty fish,"" says Löfvenborg. ""We are looking into this now using data from eight different countries across Europe.""

Adding to their surprise, the researchers found no link between soft drink intake and autoimmune response in adults with LADA.

""This could mean that the increased risk of developing LADA in relation to soft drink consumption isn't directly caused by the immune response killing beta cells - which is what we see in type 1 diabetes,"" notes Löfvenborg.

The authors stress that the study demonstrates a relative risk of diabetes with soft drink intake rather than an absolute risk, and because participants' soft drink intake was self-reported through recall over the past year, this might reduce the accuracy of the results.

MNT asked Löfvenborg whether she recommends that individuals lower their consumption of soft drinks.
""I would recommend individuals to limit their intake of sugary soft drinks, both considering risk of diabetes but also other adverse health effects, such as the risk of excess energy intake leading to overweight, poor dental health and such. 

As for artificially sweetened soft drinks, there is no nutritional value in consuming them. But even though there are suggested mechanisms and accumulating evidence suggesting adverse health effects, I still think we need to investigate this further before making any recommendations.""Josefin Edwall Löfvenborg
Löfvenborg told MNT that the team is not planning to follow up this research at present, ""but it would be very interesting to investigate the association between artificially sweetened soft drinks and diabetes risk further, to elucidate whether there is a direct effect on diabetes risk or if the associations seen in studies may be explained by other factors.""

Hospitals that use a simple strategy of enhancing communication with family members of patients dying in the intensive care unit can greatly reduce  post-traumatic stress disorder ,  anxiety  and  depression  after their loved one dies, according to a study to be presented at the American Thoracic Society International Conference in San Francisco on Monday, May 21.
   
The multicenter trial found that family members who engaged in an average of 30 minutes of a family conference with the patient's physician and received an in-depth bereavement booklet had a lower prevalence of post-traumatic  stress  syndrome after 90 days (44.6% compared with 69.2% for family members who went through a 20-minute family conference and did not receive the bereavement booklet). The group that received more counseling was also less likely to have symptoms of anxiety (44.6% vs. 67.3%), and depression (28.6% vs. 55.8%).
   
The study included family members of 126 patients dying in 22 ICUs in France.
   
""The huge effect of the intervention is surprising,"" says lead researcher Elie Azoulay, M.D., of Hopital Saint-Louis in Paris. ""We cannot compare our levels of family symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome with those from other countries,"" he noted. ""We are looking forward to conducting international comparative studies or to comparing these symptoms with those from other countries.""
   
The 15-page leaflet used in the study describes and explains end-of-life care, possible reactions after the death of a family member, how to communicate with other family members or children, and where to find assistance.
   
Dr. Azoulay said that families of dying patients in the ICU need information on the causes and the timing of death; the amount or level of healthcare the patient will receive; and information on the process of withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment. ""The patient must be comfortable at all times and family and friends must be given opportunities to express emotions and to voice concerns in a private place,"" he said.

In the journal Diabetes, researchers reveal that the two fruit compounds work together to reduce blood glucose levels, improve insulin activity, and boost the health of arteries.

Obesity affects more than a third of adults in the United States, raising their risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and some forms of cancer.

At the same time, cardiovascular disease (CVD) - a term used to describe diseases of the heart and blood vessels - is responsible for around 1 in 3 deaths in the U.S., while diabetes affects around 9.3 percent of Americans.

Such statistics highlight the need for more effective treatment strategies for these conditions. 

Now, study leader Paul Thornalley, professor in systems biology at Warwick, and colleagues suggest red grapes and oranges may pave the way for such treatments.

For their study, the team investigated the effects of a compound called trans-resveratrol (tRES), found in red grapes, and a compound found in oranges called hesperetin (HESP).

On testing a combination of the compounds in cell culture, the researchers found that it increased expression of glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) - an enzyme that neutralizes a compound called methylglyoxal (MG).

The team explains that MG is a key driver of sugar's harmful effects on the body; a combination of high MG levels and a high-calorie diet is a cause of insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes. It also damages blood vessels and can drive high cholesterol levels - a risk factor for CVD.

As such, the team hypothesizes that blocking MG by increasing Glo1 expression could reverse these effects.

""Obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease are at epidemic levels in Westernized countries. Glo1 deficiency has been identified as a driver of health problems in obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease,"" notes Prof. Thornalley.

Next, the team tested the tRES-HESP combination on 32 adults aged 18-80 who had a body mass index (BMI) of between 25-40, falling into the overweight or obese categories.

Participants were given the fruit compound combination in the form of a supplement, which they were asked to take once a day for 8 weeks.

During the study period, subjects were asked to continue with their usual diets and not to increase physical activity, enabling the researchers to gain a more accurate picture of the supplements' effects.

Blood samples were taken from participants on a regular basis during the 8-week period and analyzed for sugar levels and other blood markers. The artery health of the participants was assessed by measuring artery wall flexibility.

The researchers found that participants who had a BMI of more than 27.5 demonstrated increased Glo1 activity with the daily supplement, as well as reduced insulin levels, improved insulin activity, better artery function, and reduced blood vessel inflammation.

Subjects who were given a placebo showed no such effects, the researchers note.

Prof. Thornalley and his team point out that the doses of tRES and HESP used in this study are too high to get from fruit consumption.

However, they hope their findings will encourage pharmaceutical companies to create a drug using the compounds, paving the way for a new treatment for obesity, diabetes, and CVD.
""This is an incredibly exciting development and could have a massive impact on our ability to treat these diseases. As well as helping to treat diabetes and heart disease it could defuse the obesity time bomb."" Prof. Paul Thornalley 
""As exciting as our breakthrough is,"" he notes, ""it is important to stress that physical activity, diet, other lifestyle factors and current treatments should be adhered to.""

""Our new pharmaceutical is safe and expected to be an effective add-on treatment taken with current therapy,"" he adds.

Prof. Thornalley says the team is currently seeking commercial investors and partners in order to test the effectiveness of their treatment for diabetic kidney disease.

The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Surrey in the UK, found that eating while walking could make dieters overeat later on in the day, triggering more overeating than other forms of distraction such as watching TV or chatting with a friend.

""This may be because walking is a powerful form of distraction which disrupts our ability to process the impact eating has on our hunger,"" suggests lead author Prof. Jane Ogden. ""Or it may be because walking, even just around a corridor, can be regarded as a form of exercise which justifies overeating later on as a form of reward.""

Previous research has suggested that distraction can have a significant impact on food intake, with studies indicating that watching TV while eating can both increase food intake while watching and lead to inaccurate evaluation of actual food intake, increasing the risk of subsequent overeating.

Similar studies have also suggested that food environments and social interactions can provide forms of distraction that influence the amount of food eaten during a meal.

However, most of this research has focused on the impact of distraction on concurrent rather than future food intake, the study authors write. As a result, the authors opted to explore the impact on future food intake by using a fixed meal intake during a period of distraction for the study participants.

A total of 60 female students categorized as dieters or nondieters. The participants were each randomly assigned to eat a cereal bar under one of three different conditions. One group watched a 5-minute clip of a TV program while eating, another group had to walk along a corridor while eating and the final group ate while sat with a friend and having a conversation.

After eating the cereal bar, the participants completed a brief questionnaire about it before being asked to take part in an unsupervised taste test. Separate bowls of chocolate, carrot sticks, chips and grapes were presented to the participants, who were instructed to rate the foods according to how much they liked them and asked to ""eat as much as you like.""

The researchers recorded how much of the food the participants had consumed after they had left the room.

Dieters who ate their cereal bar while walking around went on to eat more snacks during the taste test. In particular, the researchers found that they ate around five times more chocolate than other participants.

The researchers write that this finding supports the idea that higher levels of dietary restraint could make individuals more susceptible to the effects of distraction.

They acknowledge, however, that the taste test was very close in time to the distraction intervention. The researchers suggest that further research is needed to assess whether walking can trigger overeating in the longer term.

Prof. Ogden explains why distraction might affect food intake:

""Fullness is not only the result of brain and chemical reactions, but a perception that is influenced by learning, emotion and distraction. If we eat 'on the go' or in front of a computer, we will feel less full as our attention is diverted away from the meal and we don't learn the association between food and mealtimes.""

She says that although walking was found to have the most impact on food intake during the study, any form of distraction while eating can lead to weight gain. As a result, taking a proper lunch break away from desks makes workers feel fuller and less inclined to snack on unhealthy food later on.

The University of Surrey have also designed a short quiz to demonstrate how lunch hour habits can have a big impact on your health.

Hospital admission rates are 55 per cent higher in some areas than in others because of a greater prevalence of conditions such as diabetes, alcoholism, dementia and socioeconomic deprivation.  According to published research, those admission rates could be reduced if GPs were better supported to provide more specialist care for chronic conditions and difficult-to-reach groups.

The study, carried out by the University of Bristol's School of Social and Community Medicine, measured how much admission rates varied between the 8,000 general practices in England during 2011/12, and included 1.8 million admissions.

This study focused on ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) such as diabetes, alcoholism, asthma and dementia, where the provision of better care outside hospital, by GPs and other healthcare professionals, can potentially reduce the need for admission.

Overall, researchers found that admission rates in some practices were 55 per cent higher than others. Chronic conditions such as diabetes, schizophrenia and hypertension tended to be much more variable than acute conditions such as strokes and hip fractures, as were those that disproportionately affect deprived communities, such as alcoholism.

Dr John Busby, lead author of the study, published in The British Journal of General Practice, said: ""Admission rates for some of the conditions in our study, including alcoholism, schizophrenia and diabetes, were over three times higher in some practices than others. Clearly, this raises important questions about why these differences exist and what can be done to standardise care around best practice.

""Existing mechanisms, such as the quality and outcomes framework and NICE guidelines, aim to ensure that patients receive a consistent quality of primary care across all practices in England. Our results suggest that these might not be working effectively and that new strategies are required.""

Previous studies have looked at the variation in admission rates for some of these conditions. However, they have tended to focus on a small number of health conditions and have used different methodologies, making it almost impossible to draw comparisons across studies.  

This latest study from Bristol applied the same methods to a broad range of conditions, enabling researchers to make more accurate comparisons and to identify which conditions the NHS could focus on in order to improve care.

""Substantial differences in admission rates among general practices could mean that some patients are receiving suboptimal care,"" added Dr Busby. ""Our research suggests that differences in the way GP care is delivered across England could have an important impact on patient health. This could include sub-optimal management of chronic disease which puts patients at higher risk of hospital admission, but also overly-cautious referrals to hospital, or a lack of alternatives to treat patients in the community. Clearly this matters to patients as most would prefer not to be admitted to hospital if it can be avoided, but it is also extremely important to the NHS finances as unplanned hospital admissions are expensive and can disrupt other care."" 

Researchers now intend to explore why such large variations exist between practices for some conditions, and how those reasons might help improve care.  A follow-up investigation is being carried out to assess how the characteristics of a general practice are related to admission rates. This includes factors such as the distance to the nearest A&E, how easy it is to see a GP, how often patients can see their preferred GPs, and how many hospital beds are available in the local area.

Dr Busby added: ""Given the results of this study, it will be interesting to see if the importance of each of these factors differs by condition. The way in which primary care is delivered is evolving rapidly, it is important that these changes are informed by good-quality evidence.""

In a trial conducted by researchers at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute and Introgen Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:INGN) results proved positive for patients with advanced  lung cancer .  Following INGN 225 treatment and  chemotherapy , 62 percent of patients demonstrated  tumor  responses to immunotherapy. INGN 225 is an investigational p53 based immunotherapy. Historically, response rates to second line chemotherapy in this disease range from only five to 25 percent.  Similar patients with this type of lung cancer do not have a good prognosis and most live less than six months but patients on this study survived for almost 12 months.    

\""The response rate to INGN 225 in combination with subsequent chemotherapy is significantly higher than expected.  This study provides clinical support for an emerging paradigm where the effect of  cancer  immunotherapy can be substantially enhanced by its combination with chemotherapy.  The results of this study are very encouraging and warrant continued clinical evaluation of INGN 225,\"" says principal investigator Dr. Dmitry Gabrilovich. Moffitt\'s Dr. Scott Antonia served as co-principal investigator on the study.    

INGN 225 is an investigational immunotherapy that utilizes an adenovector to deliver the p53 gene (Ad-p53) to a patient\'s immune cells, stimulating an anti-tumor immune response.  In the study, dendritic cells were collected from each patient following the last dose of first-line chemotherapy, and treated in the laboratory with Ad-p53, to generate the INGN 225 immunotherapy. Patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer received INGN 225 repeatedly at 2-week intervals, with most patients receiving three administrations. p53-specific immune responses were evaluated, as were objective clinical responses to the immunotherapy and subsequent chemotherapy.  Induction of p53-specific immune responses were observed in the majority of patients following INGN 225 therapy.    

\""The accumulation of high levels of p53 protein in cancer cells relative to normal cells makes p53 an excellent target for cancer immunotherapy.  The clinical data obtained in this trial is very promising and demonstrates the potential of INGN 225 to sensitize patients to the effects of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents,\"" says Dr. Robert E. Sobol, Introgen\'s senior vice president of Medical and Scientific Affairs.    

The American Cancer Society supported the trial with a grant. The data appear in the February 1 issue of Clinical Cancer Research, one of the premier journals in the field of cancer research. INGN 225 is also being evaluated in a Phase I/II trial in patients with  breast cancer .

Children with symptoms of  anxiety  and  depression  may have an increased tendency to use ecstasy in adolescence or young adulthood, finds a study published online by the BMJ today.
   
The use of ecstasy is associated with emotional health problems, such as depression, psychotic symptoms, and anxiety disorders. But it\'s not clear whether emotional problems are a consequence of using ecstasy or emotional problems lead to ecstasy use.
   
Researchers in the Netherlands investigated whether use of ecstasy is preceded by symptoms of behavioural and emotional problems in childhood and early adolescence.
   
They assessed ecstasy use in 1580 individuals from childhood into adulthood. The first assessment took place in 1983, before ecstasy appeared as a recreational drug in the Netherlands. Use of the drug was then assessed 14 years later, providing a unique opportunity to investigate if a pathway from behavioural and emotional problems leading to ecstasy use exists.
   
Individuals with signs of anxiety and depression in 1983 showed an increased risk of starting to use ecstasy.
   
Ecstasy\'s effects are supposed to include enhanced feelings of bonding with other people, euphoria, or relaxation, say the authors. Individuals with signs of anxiety or depression may be particularly susceptible to these positive effects and may therefore use ecstasy to relieve their symptoms.
   
However, long term exposure to ecstasy may result in increased depressive symptoms. Individuals with signs of anxiety or depression in childhood are at risk of using ecstasy and may develop depressive symptoms. This may explain part of the link that has been found between ecstasy use and later depression in other studies, add the authors.
   
Other factors not tested in this study may account for the increased tendency to use ecstasy in some individuals. They include the social environment, novelty seeking, or substance use of parents.
   
\""Focusing on these vulnerable individuals in future studies will increase our insight into the potential harmful effects of ecstasy on brain neurotransmitter systems and associated psychopathology,\"" they conclude.

Forgiving nature benefits back   

A new study from Duke University Medical Center demonstrates that among people who have chronic  back pain , those who have forgiven others experience lower levels of pain and less associated psychological problems like anger and  depression  than those who have not forgiven.    
The findings will be presented at the Conference on Forgiveness in Atlanta October 24-25.
   
ABSTRACT:   
Carson, James: Correlates of Forgiveness & Preliminary Results from a Loving Kindness Meditation Intervention for Low Back Pain Patients 
   
1. Discuss the value of fostering forgiveness among chronic pain patients.    
2. Identify specific consistent relationships between measures of forgiveness and important aspects of living with persistent pain.    
3. Recognize specific techniques for promoting forgiveness in medical patients. 
   
This presentation will report data on baseline correlates of forgiveness and preliminary treatment outcomes among patients with persistent low back pain who are enrolled in a novel intervention study.    

Chronic pain is a medical condition which is particularly relevant to the investigation of forgiveness. Anger and resentment - about an offender perceived as causing or aggravating their condition, or related to the chronicity of their condition - are emotions that are salient features of many persons' chronic pain experience.    Anger can be a major complicating factor in the treatment of persistent pain, and also negatively impact patients' interactions with family members, co-workers, and health care providers. 
   
The overall purpose of this study is to explore whether a novel, positive emotion-oriented strategy - loving-kindness meditation, a centuries-old Buddhist approach to developing love and forgiveness - can foster forgiveness, reduce anger, and improve the pain and adjustment of these patients.    

Forgiveness in this context is understood as a person's act of deliberately giving up anger and resentment felt toward an offender, and fostering qualities of love, understanding, and compassion in their place. In this randomized controlled trial, patients are being assigned to the loving-kindness meditation protocol or a standard care control condition. 
   
Findings will be reported on the baseline relationship of forgiveness to pain, anger, depression, and psychological distress among 58 patients. Taken together, these findings suggest that there is a strong and consistent relationship between forgiveness and important aspects of living with persistent pain, including pain itself and measures of adjustment. 
   
Preliminary treatment outcomes based on data from the first 33 randomized patients will also be reported. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate forgiveness in a medical population. Potential implications of our preliminary findings will be discussed, along with methodological issues in the study of forgiveness among medical patients.

The study, led by Prof. Robert A Waterland of Baylor and Texas Children's Hospital, is published in The FASEB Journal.

In the wake of the current obesity epidemic taking place in the US, finding ways of encouraging people to be physically active has important public health implications. 

Currently in the US, more than one third of adults are obese. For children and adolescents between 2-19 years of age, 17% are obese, putting them at risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.

Prof. Waterland says previous observational studies have found that pregnant women who are physically active have children who are more likely to be physically active. These results, however, could be due to the mothers' influence on the children post-birth.

Furthermore, mothers could pass on a genetic predisposition to be physically active to their children.

""Our study in a mouse model is important because we can take all those effects out of the equation,"" says Prof. Waterland.

To conduct their study, the researchers used female mice that naturally enjoyed running and then divided them into two separate groups. While one group was allowed access to running wheels both before and during pregnancy, the other group was not allowed access.

The researchers observed that the mice with running wheels ran an average of 10 km per night. Although they ran less as their pregnancies progressed, they ran or walked around 3 km per night in the third trimester.

Results showed that the mice born to mothers that were physically active during pregnancy were 50% more physically active, compared with the offspring of mothers that did not exercise.

And this physical activity continued in later adulthood, even enhancing the ability of the mice to lose fat during a 3-week exercise program.

""I think our results offer a very positive message,"" says Prof. Waterland. ""If expectant mothers know that exercise is not only good for them but also may offer lifelong benefits for their babies, I think they will be more motivated to get moving."" He adds:

""Although most people assume that an individual's tendency to be physically active is determined by genetics, our results clearly show that the environment can play an important role during fetal development.""

The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend that pregnant women who are free of complications exercise at least 30 minutes on most days to prevent gestational diabetes, reduce backaches, increase energy, improve mood and promote better sleep.

There are certain sports that are particularly safe and beneficial during pregnancy, including: walking, swimming, cycling, aerobics and even running.

Prof. Waterland notes that although their study was conducted in mice, ""several human studies have reported results consistent with ours.""

He and his colleagues say that if their results can be confirmed in humans, it could be an effective way of combatting the obesity and physical inactivity epidemic we are currently facing.

Concluding their study, the researchers write:

""Our finding show for the first time that maternal physical activity during pregnancy affects the offspring's lifelong propensity for physical activity and may have important implications for combating the worldwide epidemic of physical inactivity and obesity.""

Medical News Today recently reported on a study that suggested stress before pregnancy is linked to birth weight.

If you have a child with newly-diagnosed eczema, you may be wondering how often you should bathe him. You are not alone. For more than 100 years, doctors have been asked about the risks and benefits of frequent bathing for those with atopic dermatitis (eczema). And parents haven't gotten consistent responses.

A new article in Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, the scientific publication of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) looks at the research and answers the question. According to the authors, daily bathing is fine, as long as it's followed by lots of moisturizer. In other words, ""soak and smear.""

""A number of medical groups have commented on the general role of bathing in eczema,"" says allergist Ivan D. Cardona, MD, lead author of the paper and ACAAI member. ""But they don't all agree on the best bathing practices. Specifically, many groups don't comment on bathing frequency. Because parents are confused, and because they often take their questions to their allergist, we wanted to examine the studies that have been published on the topic, and see if there was agreement on just how often children with eczema should be bathed.""

Eczema involves extremely dry skin, and some medical professionals think infrequent bathing (defined in this paper as less than once a day) is the best way to avoid irritating the skin. They believe infrequent bathing helps keep skin hydrated because it avoids constant evaporation of water, which can be drying. Infrequent bathing also means less use of the soaps which can aggravate eczema.

Those in favor of frequent bathing (defined in the paper as at least once a day) believe the presence of very dry skin requires hydration with daily baths followed by moisturizer. Limited use of pH balanced skin cleansers should also be part of frequent bathing, along with gentle patting dry, and the immediate application of a moisturizer to ""seal"" in moisture. This process is known as ""soak and smear.""

""The smear part is really the most important element, because unless moisturizer is applied immediately, then the skin is likely to dry out even more,"" says allergist Neal Jain, MD, ACAAI Fellow and co-author of the paper. ""The weight of the evidence in the literature we reviewed and our experience in caring for these patients suggests daily bathing with 'soak and smear' is more effective for soothing dry skin from eczema.""

People who watch TV for five or more hours a day appear to be at much greater risk of dying from a blood clot in the lung - a condition known as pulmonary embolism. Simple steps similar to those recommended for travelers on long plane flights, such as flexing leg muscles or standing up and stretching may reduce risk.

Watching a lot of television every day may increase your risk of dying from a blood clot in the lung, according to new research in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation.

A lung blood clot, known medically as a pulmonary embolism, usually begins as a clot in the leg or pelvis as a result of inactivity and slowed blood flow. If the clot breaks free, it can travel to a lung and become lodged in a small blood vessel, where it is especially dangerous.

From 1988 to 1990, Japanese researchers asked 86,024 participants, age 40-79, how many hours they spent watching TV. Over the next 19 years, 59 participants died of a pulmonary embolism.

Researchers found that compared to participants who watched TV less than 2.5 hours each day, deaths from a pulmonary embolism increased by:

""Pulmonary embolism occurs at a lower rate in Japan than it does in Western countries, but it may be on the rise,"" said Hiroyasu Iso, M.D., Ph.D., professor of public health at Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine and study corresponding author. ""The Japanese people are increasingly adopting sedentary lifestyles, which we believe is putting them at increased risk.""

Authors noted that the risk is likely greater than the findings suggest. Deaths from pulmonary embolism are believed to be underreported because diagnosis is difficult. The most common symptoms of pulmonary embolism - chest pain and shortness of breath - are the same as other life-threatening conditions, and diagnosis requires imaging that many hospitals are not equipped to provide.

Researchers accounted for several factors that might have influenced findings, including obesity, diabetes, cigarette smoking and hypertension. After the number of hours spent watching TV, obesity appeared to have the next strongest link to pulmonary embolism. 

Toru Shirakawa, M.D., study first author and a research fellow in public health at Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, said the findings may be particularly relevant to Americans. Other studies indicate U.S. adults watch more television than Japanese adults.

""Nowadays, with online video streaming, the term 'binge-watching' to describe viewing multiple episodes of television programs in one sitting has become popular,"" Shirakawa said.  ""This popularity may reflect a rapidly growing habit.""

Authors said people who watch a lot of TV can take several easy steps to reduce their risk of developing blood clots in their legs that may then move to their lungs.

""After an hour or so, stand up, stretch, walk around, or while you're watching TV, tense and relax your leg muscles for 5 minutes,"" said Iso, noting this advice is similar to that given to travelers on long plane flights. He added that drinking water may also help and, in the long run, shedding pounds if overweight is likely to reduce risk.

The study recorded participants' viewing habits before computers, tablets and smartphones became popular sources of information and entertainment. Authors believe new studies are needed to determine the effect of these new technologies on pulmonary embolism risk.

In recent years, there has been an increasing number of studies documenting the harms of sedentary behavior - defined as any waking activity that involves sitting or lying down, such as watching TV or working on the computer.

Research has repeatedly linked sedentary behavior with increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and more.

A study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine earlier this year estimated that prolonged sitting is responsible for 430,000 all-cause deaths over 54 countries, and a more recent study claimed that sedentary behavior is a leading risk factor for mortality, second only to smoking.

While some studies suggest that physical activity can offset the harms of the prolonged sitting, other research claims that is not the case.

The new statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) - published in the journal Circulation - supports the latter, finding that no matter how much exercise one does, sitting too much is detrimental to health.

Deborah Rohm Young, Ph.D., chair of the AHA statement and  director of behavioral research at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and colleagues reached their findings after conducting a review of the current evidence on sedentary behavior.

Highlighting the fact that Americans spend too long sitting, the review revealed that younger adults in the United States are sedentary for around 6-8 hours a day, while adults aged 60 and older spend around 8.6-9.6 hours a day sedentary.

The authors explain that sedentary behaviors normally have an energy expenditure of 1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) or less. Slow, leisurely walking or light housework uses around 2.5 METs, while vigorous to moderate physical activity uses around 3 METs or more.

Based on current evidence, Young and colleagues found that spending too much time sitting may raise the risk of impaired insulin sensitivity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause death.

What is more, the review revealed that these risks are not reduced by moderate to vigorous physical activity, suggesting that prolonged sitting is harmful to health, regardless of how much one exercises.

Young says that, at present, they are unable to pinpoint exactly how long is too long when it comes to sitting, but for now, their advice is to reduce the amount of time spent sedentary and increase the amount of time spent active.
""There's a lot of research that we need to do. This statement is important because it starts the ball rolling and suggests sedentary behavior may play an important role in heart health and more. 

But, it's too early to make conclusive recommendations other than to encourage Americans to 'sit less, move more.'""Deborah Rohm Young, Ph.D.
In line with the AHA's physical activity guidelines, the authors recommend engaging in around 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily; they note that exercising in smaller amounts each day is more beneficial than trying to fit in the same amount of exercise in fewer days.

New research published in Diabetologia (the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [EASD]) shows that children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have a higher incidence of enterovirus infections prior to experiencing the autoimmune processes which lead to their T1D. The study is by Professor Heikki Hyöty and Dr Hanna Honkanen, University of Tampere, Finland, and colleagues.

Type 1 diabetes is caused by an immune-mediated process that damages insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. The subclinical phase of the disease can be identified by detecting autoantibodies. Enteroviruses have been linked to type 1 diabetes in studies showing an increased frequency of these viruses in the blood and pancreas of diabetic and autoantibody-positive individuals and in studies showing an increased frequency of enterovirus antibodies in people with T1D. However, this association has not been seen in all studies.

In this new study, the authors analysed whether the presence of enteroviruses in stools was associated with the appearance of islet autoimmunity in the ""Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention Study"" in Finland. The current study is the largest study to date in which enteroviruses have been analysed in stool samples collected over time from children who developed signs of a beta cell-damaging process.

A total of 1673 stool samples from 129 case children who turned positive for multiple islet autoantibodies and 3108 stool samples from 282 matched control children were screened for the presence of enterovirus ribonucleic acid (RNA - the genetic material found in viruses). Altogether, 108 infections were diagnosed in the 129 case children and 169 infections in the 282 control children during the whole follow-up (mean 0.8 vs 0.6 infections per child). This difference was also seen in infections that occurred prior to the appearance of autoantibodies (0.6 vs 0.4 infections per child).

Further analyses showed that the excess of infections in case children occurred more than 12 months before the first autoantibody-positive sample was taken. During this time period, an average of 0.62 infections were diagnosed per case child compared with 0.33 infections per control child, corresponding to 6.3 vs 2.1 infections per 10 follow-up years. Put another way, children with type 1 diabetes were found to have had three times more enterovirus infections than control children.

The authors say: ""The present study suggests that enterovirus infections in young children are associated with the appearance of islet autoantibodies with a time lag of about 1 year. This finding supports previous observations from other prospective studies suggesting that enterovirus infections may play a role in the initiation of the beta cell-damaging process.""

They add that large international studies are in progress to study this association in different countries and to understand the mechanisms that make it possible for these viruses to infect insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

They say: ""It will also be important to explore the possibility of creating a vaccine against these viruses to find out whether it could prevent type 1 diabetes.""

More and more studies seem to suggest that components of the Mediterranean diet, either in isolation or taken together, can have a beneficial effect on various aspects of human health. 

The ""traditional"" Mediterranean diet - consisting of large amounts of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, olive oil, a moderate amount of fish, dairy, and wine, as well as a limited intake of red meat - has been shown to improve cardiometabolic health.  

Research ranging from observational studies to randomized trials has shown the diet to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity, aid weight loss, and contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease.  

Other studies have suggested that the diet helps to keep mental and physical health well into old age and can reduce the risk of premature death. 

New research published in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, looks specifically at the benefits of the Mediterranean diet on brain health in elderly adults.  

Researchers led by Michelle Luciano, Ph.D. - from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland - looked at the effects of the Mediterranean diet (MeDi) on total brain volume, gray matter volume, and the thickness of the cortex. 

The authors explain that, with age, the human brain shrinks, and more and more of its cells die. This may cause problems with learning and memory.

The study followed 967 people aged between 73 and 76 years, who lived in Scotland and who did not have dementia, over a period of 3 years.

The 967 participants were asked to complete food questionnaires when they were 70 years old - 3 years prior to collecting data on their brain volume. 

Then, 562 of these people had a magnetic resonance imaging brain scan at the age of 73, in order to measure total brain volume, gray matter volume, and cortical thickness. Of these, 401 people had a second brain scan at age 76. 

People's dietary habits were calculated using a food frequency questionnaire. The brain measurements were compared with how well the participants adhered to the MeDi during the 3-year period. 

The scientists found an association between MeDi adherence and brain volume. 

Participants who did not follow the diet closely were likely to develop brain atrophy over the 3-year interval.  

More specifically, poor adherence to the diet was associated with a 0.5 percent greater reduction in total brain volume than those who had followed the diet closely.

A 0.5 percent decrease in brain volume is half the size of what is considered a normal decrease due to the natural aging process. 

Researchers adjusted for variables that might have influenced the changes in brain volume, including age, education, and health conditions such as diabetes or hypertension.

The study found no association between the diet and gray matter volume or thickness of the cortex. 

Contrary to previous studies, this research did not find a relationship between fish and meat consumption and changes in brain volume. This suggests that other individual components of the diet - or all of its components taken in combination - might be responsible for the association. 

Additionally, unlike previous research - which measured the brain at one point in time -  this study examined changes in brain volume over time.
 
""In our study, eating habits were measured before brain volume was, which suggests that the diet may be able to provide long-term protection to the brain. Still, larger studies are needed to confirm these results.""

The results of a recent study show that children who report eating more polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), found in tree nuts, seeds and fatty fish, and consume a higher ratio of PUFA: saturated fatty acids (SFAs), have more lean body mass, lower percent body fat, and less intra-abdominal fat (belly fat).

The study was published in The Journal of Nutrition and conducted by researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Health and Wellness Center and the University of Colorado School of Medicine at the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colo. in collaboration with the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

The study looked at a group of racially diverse children ages 7-12 (39% European-American, 34% African-American, and 27% Hispanic-American). Each child, with parental supervision, provided two separate self-reports of their 24-hour dietary intakes.

""Studies have identified a variety of benefits of including PUFAs into an adult's diet, particularly omega-3 fatty acids,"" said Michelle Cardel, PhD, RD, the study's lead author. ""Our data suggests that consumption of PUFAs is associated with improved body composition in diverse groups of children. It's important to note, however, that this study was cross-sectional and no causation can be concluded. Randomized experiments are needed to confirm these findings.""

Each child's body composition and abdominal fat distribution were measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography scans, respectively. Those who ate more PUFAs and had a higher ratio of PUFA: SFAs in their reported diet were found to be leaner, have less body fat and less abdominal adiposity.

""Hopefully this work will stimulate additional research to determine if there is a causal relationship between dietary PUFAs, body fat and lean mass in kids,"" Cardel said. ""Until then, children should consume fatty fish, such as salmon, twice a week to reach Institute of Medicine recommendations for omega-3 fatty acids.""

Cardel is a nutrition scientist and registered dietitian. She plans to continue her research exploring the environmental, behavioral, social, dietary, and genetic factors that influence the development of obesity in diverse groups of children.

The meta-analysis, published in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health, looked at data from relevant studies published between 2001 and 2014.

""Higher fish consumption may be beneficial in the primary prevention of depression,"" the authors write. ""Future studies are needed to further investigate whether this association varies according to the type of fish.""

Depression affects an estimated 350 million people worldwide, making it the world's leading cause of disability. As things stand, it is also projected to become the world's second leading cause of disease burden by 2020.

Unfortunately, current forms of treatment for the condition are considered to be unsatisfactory on account of poor compliance rates and numerous potential side effects. Consequently, many researchers are interested in assessing lifestyle factors that could influence the risk of depression.

One such lifestyle factor is diet. Many previous studies have indicated that food consumption may be related to the risk of depression. One recent meta-analysis found that following a healthy diet was associated with a reduced risk of the disorder, the authors note, although this could not separate the influence of different dietary components, such as fruit, vegetables or fish.

Over the past year, Medical News Today has reported on a number of studies that have found health benefits for fish consumption. Last month, a study revealed that the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil could reduce the risk of psychosis. In February, another study suggested that collagen from tilapia fish could help wounds heal faster.

For their review, the researchers identified 16 suitable articles that were eligible for inclusion, incorporating data from 26 studies and a total of 150,278 participants. Of these studies, 10 involved participants in Europe and seven involved participants in North America. The remainder involved participants in Asia, Oceania and South America.

The researchers found that in the European studies, there was a significant association between high consumption of fish and a 17% reduced risk of depression compared with the lowest levels of fish consumption. Although they observed this association in both cohort and cross-sectional studies, it did not emerge in studies from other continents.

When examining the effects of fish consumption on men and women separately, the researchers found that this association remained, with a 20% reduced risk in men and 16% reduced risk in women.

Differences in fish type, fish preservation and cooking styles could be a determining factor in the inconsistencies observed between different studies, the researchers suggest.

Despite the association only being found in the European studies, the researchers conclude that their review shows that higher fish consumption is significantly associated with reduced risk of depression. They also suggest that there could be a biological explanation for this association.

Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil could change the structure of brain membranes and alter levels of dopamine and serotonin in the body - two neurotransmitters that are believed to play a role in depression.

""In addition, high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals may have a protective effect on depression,"" the authors add.

Omega-3 fatty acids are frequently heralded for their healthful properties. However, in a recent study reported by MNT, omega-3 supplements failed to demonstrate any effect against cognitive decline. This finding is significant as some previous studies have suggested that omega-3 may have a protective role in maintaining cognitive function.

Senior author Dr. Victor Novack, of Soroka University Medical Center and Ben-Gurion University in Beer Sheva, Israel, and colleagues found that air pollution exposure can increase blood sugar, cholesterol levels, and other factors that may raise heart disease risk.

In the United States, heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women, killing around 610,000 Americans every year.

Obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes are among the numerous factors known to increase the risk of heart disease.

Now, the new research from Dr. Novack and colleagues suggests air pollution could be added to the list.

For their study, the team analyzed the data of 73,117 adults living in southern Israel, where particulate matter (PM) - pollution that is made up of very small particles and liquid droplets - is high.

All participants were either smokers, or had been diagnosed with diabetes, ischemic heart disease, high blood pressure, or high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels - known as dyslipidemia.

The researchers used satellite data on the amount of sunlight that was blocked by PM, alongside other weather data, to create a model that enabled them to estimate the daily air pollution each participant was exposed to, based on their address.


By analyzing more than 600,000 blood samples from the participants, the researchers found that exposure to higher average levels of PM in the previous 3 months was associated with an increase in heart disease risk factors.

Specifically, they found that, compared with participants with lower PM exposure, those with higher PM exposure had greater increases in blood glucose levels, LDL cholesterol levels - known as ""bad"" cholesterol - and triglyceride levels. Triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood.

Furthermore, greater PM exposure was associated with lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which is the ""good"" cholesterol.

Participants with diabetes fared worst with higher PM exposure, the researchers report, though those who were using non-insulin medications appeared to be protected, showing smaller changes in levels of blood sugar and cholesterol.

The team notes that exposure to air pollution did not have an immediate effect on blood samples; no changes in blood sugar, cholesterol, or triglyceride levels were identified in samples taken as early as 7 days from PM exposure.

It was cumulative exposure to PM over a 3-month period that was linked to increased risk factors for heart disease.
""While air pollution is linked with relatively small changes in cardiometabolic risk factors, the continuous nature of exposure and the number of people affected gives us cause for concern. 

Even small changes in glucose levels and glycemic control can contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular disease."" Dr. Victor Novack

Although the number of people being diagnosed with HIV has fallen dramatically in the past decade, HIV still affects more than 1.2 million U.S. individuals, and 1 in 8 of those who have the virus are not aware of their infection. 

Diabetes is also a serious health concern in the country. The condition affects more than 29 million people in the U.S., and another 86 million have prediabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 

New research links the two conditions, suggesting that adults with HIV are predisposed to developing diabetes. The list of currently known risk factors for diabetes includes obesity and a lack of physical activity, being 45 years old or above, having a family history of the disease, or having gestational diabetes.  

New research, however - published in the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care - suggests that the list may have to be amended to include HIV infection. As the authors of the new study point out, previous research has in fact associated HIV with diabetes, but the link has been widely contested in the medical community. 

Therefore, researchers - led by Dr. Alfonso Hernandez-Romieu from the Department of Epidemiology at Emory University in Atlanta, GA - set out to calculate the prevalence of diabetes among people living with HIV and compare it with that of the general U.S. population. 

To do this, they used data from the Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) - which contained nationally representative clinical and behavioral information on 8,610 adults with HIV - and from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which comprised 5,604 adults from the general population. 

Dr. Hernandez-Romieu and team used regression models to compare the prevalence of diabetes in the two groups, as well as to examine the risk factors commonly associated with diabetes among adults with HIV. 

Individuals in the HIV group were predominantly male (over 73 percent) and black non-Hispanic (over 41 percent). They were at least 45 years old, had attended higher education, and they lived above the federal poverty line. Around a quarter of them had a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kilograms per square meter or higher. According to the CDC, this means that 1 in 4 of the HIV participants were clinically obese.

Additionally, around 1 in 5 adults in the HIV group also had a hepatitis C infection.

In the general population group, almost half of the participants were male, and over 11 percent were non-Hispanic black. Over half of them were 45 years old and above, and almost 60 percent had higher education. Less than 2 percent were infected with hepatitis C.

Diabetes was found in 10.3 percent of those diagnosed with HIV and receiving medical care, compared with 8.3 percent in the general population. 

In the HIV-positive group, older age, obesity, and CD4 T lymphocytes count - which is an indicator of immune health - all associated with a higher diabetes risk.  

However, when researchers adjusted for all of these variables - together with sex, ethnicity, education, poverty, and hepatitis C infection -  the diabetes risk was still significantly higher among the adults with HIV than in the general population. 

Specifically, 1 in 10 adults with HIV had diabetes, half of whom had type 2 diabetes. Overall, after adjusting for all the variables, the diabetes prevalence was 3.8 percent higher among HIV-infected individuals than in the general population. 

The authors caution that their study is purely observational, so they cannot draw any conclusions regarding cause and effect. 

They also add that given the high efficacy of modern HIV treatment, individuals that are HIV-positive live well into old age, when they become vulnerable to serious illnesses - including diabetes. Dr. Alfonso C. Hernandez-Romieu and colleagues conclude: 
 ""Although obesity is a risk factor for prevalent [diabetes] among HIV infected adults, when compared with the general U.S. adult population, [these] adults may have higher [diabetes] prevalence at younger ages, and in the absence of obesity [...] Additional research would help to determine whether [diabetes] screening guidelines should be modified to include HIV infection as a risk factor for [the condition], and to identify optimal management strategies in this population.""

Two patients with  skin cancer ,  melanoma , have been in full remission for 18 months, as a result of receiving gene therapy, aimed at genetically engineering the patients' own white blood cells, so that they can identify and destroy  cancer  cells, say scientists from the National Cancer Institute, USA.   

NIH Director Elias A. Zerhouni, M.D., said ""These results represent the first time gene therapy has been used successfully to treat cancer. Moreover, we hope it will be applicable not only to melanoma, but also for a broad range of common cancers, such as breast and  lung cancer .""   

You can read about this in the journal  Science , September 1 issue.   

The scientists aimed to boost the function of T-lymphocytes - white blood cells that identify and destroy cells that should not be in the body  (foreign cells) .  For patients with advanced cancer their T-Lymphocytes are not very effective.   

The patients' normal lymphocytes were extracted, genetically modified so that their ability to fight cancer was enhanced, and then placed back.  The scientists hoped the modified cells would gradually replace the patients' less effective lymphocytes and attack the cancer cells with more vigour.   

Two of seventeen patients with advanced melanoma soon went into a sustained remission, and have remained so for a year-and-a-half - quite an acheivement for gene therapy.   

Even for the other 15 patients who did not respond so well, their modified T-cells still remained in their immune systems for months.  Those 15 patients did not respond well because this procedure was so new nobody really knew the best was to do it.  In other words, the research is still in its early stages, say the scientists.  I fact, they were surprised that anyone would respond as well.

Online communities could easily be used to offer people with chronic illnesses, such as  diabetes  , wireless healthcare services via mobile phones and the internet. The approach, outlined in the  International Journal of Networking and Virtual Organisations , would reduce healthcare costs and empower many patients to manage their condition more effectively.
   
Providing optimal healthcare while keeping costs down is important medically and economically for the growing number of people with chronic illnesses such as diabetes,  high blood pressure , and  asthma . Prevention and early detection of disease, especially when no cure exists, can be critical in this regard allowing a condition to be better managed at a stage when progression to a more serious state can be avoided.
   
Quality of life can be improved for many patients by adopting this approach and so reducing the amount of healthcare interventions. As such, effective chronic disease management relies on regular monitoring that allows informed patients to take responsibility for managing their wellness.
   
Nilmini Wickramasinghe who has recently joined RMIT University, in Australia after 15 years of conducting research in IT and healthcare in the USA is working with Steve Goldberg of INET International Inc. in Thornhill, Ontario, Canada to develop a wireless system to empower patients that supports patient self-management for diabetes and other chronic diseases.
   
""Diabetes is an important chronic disease increasing in prevalence throughout not only North America but also the world,"" the researchers explain. ""Given the treatment costs for this increasing population, coupled with the increased non-working hours due to treatment requirements, increases in the prevalence of diabetes as is projected is indeed alarming to any healthcare system.""
   
Technology initiatives in healthcare to date have had mixed results, the researchers add, but this is perhaps due to a failure of such initiatives to capture the richness and potential of the modern healthcare environment rather than an intrinsic flaw in taking an information technology approach. Indeed, INET and Wickramasinghe are working towards addressing this issue.
   
In a pilot study with twenty patients, the INET team led by Sheldon Silver, has already demonstrated that it is possible for patients to dial in their own blood glucose readings using a mobile phone and to receive timely feedback from their healthcare worker. The next step is to exploit online communities to make use of the additional context and tools that are then available. Social networks such as Facebook and Linkedin are playing a pivotal role in moving internet users from isolation to a connected network of family, friends and business associates, the team explains. The logical extension of this type of community for healthcare management is obvious. Indeed, US physicians have their own system in the form of the Sermo network.
   
The team outlines a model that would allow an online social network approach to be taken to patient healthcare management. Given that one out of every 10 healthcare dollars spent in the USA is spent on diabetes and its complications, such a system implemented for people with diabetes could significantly reduce costs as well as improving their quality of life.
   
""We are confident that our model is especially important when implementing a technology enable solution to any healthcare context and thus close by calling for more research in this area,"" Wickramasinghe and Goldberg conclude.

Across the United States, online vendors of e-liquids -- the nicotine-rich fluids that fuel electronic cigarettes -- are failing to take proper precautions in preventing sales to minors, according to a study by the University of California, Irvine and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Researchers found that only four of 120 vendors included in the study validated the ages of online purchasers. Fifteen of them also marketed directly to minors by providing free e-liquid products, candy and trinkets with youth appeal, such as playing cards, plastic balloon kits, bracelets and a collection of branded stickers.

While there is no current federal ban on selling e-liquids to minors, at least 48 states, including California, and two territories prohibit sales of electronic cigarettes or vaping/alternative tobacco products to minors. The industry's two leading trade associations oppose marketing or selling to those under 18.

""Regardless of whether they are members of trade associations or not, online vendors of e-liquids are not doing a good job of preventing sales to minors,"" said Dmitriy Nikitin, UCI public health researcher and study leader. ""The FDA's upcoming rules on e-cigarette products should include explicit requirements for offline and online e-liquid vendors, particularly the use of effective age verification, warning labels and child-resistant packaging.""

David Timberlake, associate professor of public health at UCI, and Rebecca Williams of UNC contributed to the study, which appears online in Nicotine & Tobacco Research. The researchers' objective was to assess whether the nascent but rapidly growing e-liquid industry successfully prevents online sales to minors and employs safety measures to avoid accidental poisonings.

For the study, three 16- and 17-year-olds attempted to purchase e-liquid products online. When queried on vendor websites, the minors gave correct names, addresses and Social Security numbers, but not correct birthdates; the provided birthdates corresponded to individuals in their mid-20s. The youths paid with debit cards that listed their names. They were instructed to provide a valid photo ID or driver's license (showing each's true age) if requested by vendors at the point of order or by delivery personnel.

The minors sought to buy single bottles of liquid nicotine from 120 vendors; they received a total of 183 bottles overall. The additional ones were included as samples with the original orders. The average cost per order was $13.16. Shipments were received from 34 U.S. states.

Of the 120 purchase attempts, only four were rejected due to the vendors' use of effective age verification. Three utilized third-party age verification software (ExpectID and AgeMatch), which nixed the youth sales after the buyers provided their real names and addresses. A fourth vendor cancelled the order after requiring the minor to upload an image of his (real) ID. One vendor claimed that the recipient's photo identification would be checked upon delivery; however, the parcel was simply left in the teen's mailbox.

""It is disconcerting that e-liquid vendors made little effort to verify buyers' ages, although not surprising, as UNC's 2015 study in JAMA Pediatrics of e-cigarette sales to minors online saw similar results,"" Williams said.

In addition, the researchers looked at the vendors' use of childproof packaging and warning labels. More than 87 percent of the ordered bottles had child-resistant caps; only 54 percent mentioned any health risks associated with nicotine use. Of the free bottles of e-liquid received, 82 percent were child-resistant. The study comes at an opportune time, with the FDA's impending regulation of electronic cigarettes and President Barack Obama's signing of a childproof packaging bill in January.

The overall results show that members of e-liquid trade associations were not significantly more likely to properly verify age, have childproof containers or employ proper labeling than nonmembers, suggesting that voluntary efforts to protect consumer safety are inadequate and that more comprehensive regulation and enforcement is required.

""UNC's ongoing Internet Tobacco Vendors Study of the e-cigarette and e-liquid industry has identified a population of thousands of vendors, indicating a large population of Internet vendors from which minors can purchase liquid nicotine and e-cigarette products without being stymied by effective age verification,"" Williams said.

""Lax oversight of the e-liquid industry may draw consumers to bypass current tobacco control restrictions implemented in face-to-face sales settings,"" Nikitin added. ""As a consequence, there may be an increase in online sales to minors. While use of child-resistant packaging is widespread, enforcement of the new federal regulations requiring such packaging may influence the vendors not currently using it to do so, leading to fewer cases of accidental nicotine poisoning.""

These findings will be welcome news for parents of the 1 in 10 infants who are born prematurely in the United States each year, as many of these infants experience problems with heart development.

Studies have shown that such developmental problems occur in the first few months of life, leading to smaller heart chambers, thickening of the heart muscle, and reduced heart function in later life.

Research has also suggested that breast-feeding has an array of health benefits for infants, including reduced risk of asthma, childhood obesity, childhood leukemia, eczema, and ear infections.

Could breast-feeding also benefit the long-term heart health of preterm infants? This is what Dr. Adam Lewandowski, of the Cardiovascular Clinical Research Facility at the University of Oxford, United Kingdom, and colleagues wanted to find out.

The researchers recently published their findings in the journal Pediatrics.

For their study, the team enrolled 102 adults in their early to mid-20s who, since birth, had been part of an earlier study that assessed how different infant feeding practices influenced health.

""We invited individuals who had been followed up throughout life to come to Oxford for a detailed cardiovascular study and used this information to investigate how different feeding regimes could affect the development of the heart in the long term,"" explains Dr. Lewandowski.

For comparison, the team enrolled a further 102 adults of a similar age who were born at full term.

As expected, the researchers found that adults who had been born preterm had reduced heart volume and poorer heart function, compared with those who had been born at full term.

However, they found that adults born preterm who had been exclusively breast-fed as an infant had better heart volume and function than those who had been formula-fed.

Furthermore, among adults born preterm who had been fed a combination of breast milk and formula as an infant, those who consumed more breast milk than formula were found to have better heart structure and function in adulthood.

The researchers say the association between breast-feeding and better later-life heart health remained after accounting for various influential factors.

Overall, the authors say their results indicate that breast-feeding may have long-term benefits for the hearts of preterm infants.
""Even the best baby formula lacks some of the growth factors, enzymes and antibodies that breast milk provides to developing babies. These results show that even in people whose premature birth has inevitably affected their development, breastfeeding may be able to improve heart development.""Dr. Adam Lewandowski

High-speed camera snapshots may have pinpointed a spot in the brain that serves as a marker for  depression . Investigators have observed that electrical chatter in the dentate gyrus-a C-shaped region of the hippocampus-contracts in depressed rats but expands again after the animals receive  antidepressants .    
The region may represent a common pathway or intersection for brain activity in those suffering from depression, offering a springboard from which to map that activity and better understand the condition, says Karl Deisseroth, a Stanford University neuroengineer and psychiatrist, who led the study published online this week by Science.    
Finding a common depression pathway in humans that could guide the search for treatments remains a ""holy grail"" of psychiatry, he says. ""One of the mysteries of depression is how there can be so many different causes … and so many different treatments."" A common pathway would bridge them, he adds.    
The researchers induced depressionlike symptoms in rats by blasting static noise or otherwise annoying the animals at unpredictable intervals for several weeks. The chronically stressed rats swam less vigorously in a tank of water, indicating their feelings of rodent hopelessness.    
To analyze the rats' brains, the team extracted brain slices from depressed and normal animals, soaked them in voltage-sensitive dye, and prodded them with electrodes next to a high-speed camera. When the brain cells fired, they activated the dye.    
The camera was trained on the hippocampus, a small peanut-shaped part of the brain known to play a role in learning and memory, including navigation, but also implicated in mood and depression. The team found a smaller aura of activity originating from the curved dentate gyrus than in normal rats.    
""We can do the equivalent of looking at one circuit board in a computer and find something that predicts behavior,"" Deisseroth says.    
The result fit with prior research indicating that accelerated growth of new brain cells in the dentate gyrus, in a process called neurogenesis, is necessary for antidepressants to cure rats of their depression. When fed fluoxetine (Prozac), the depressed rats experienced more rapid neurogenesis and the range of electrical signals from their dentate gyri spread as far as in normal rats, the group reports.    
Matching up depressed behavior with hippocampal activity is ""pretty amazing,"" says Helen Mayberg, professor of psychiatry and neurology at Emory University in Atlanta. ""It tells us the hippocampus is very involved,"" she says, ""but it doesn't tell us it's the origin of the problem.""    
The hippocampus sends and receives information to and from many other brain regions, and mapping those connections in depressed animals is the next step, she says.    
The causes of depression remain elusive, but Deisseroth sees a connection between the disease and the way that damage to the hippocampus can prevent people from remembering where things are located.    
Similarly, although depression sufferers may face the same obstacles as others, ""they just can't seem to see a path forward,"" he says. With any luck, he adds, his group's finding will put researchers on a path to figuring out a way to help them.

A new study by Florida State University researchers has found that people who were verbally abused as children grow up to be self-critical adults prone to  depression  and  anxiety .    

People who were verbally abused had 1.6 times as many symptoms of depression and anxiety as those who had not been verbally abused and were twice as likely to have suffered a mood or anxiety disorder over their lifetime, according to psychology Professor Natalie Sachs-Ericsson, the study's lead author.    

""We must try to educate parents about the long-term effects of verbal abuse on their children,"" Sachs-Ericsson said. ""The old saying about sticks and stones was wrong. Names will forever hurt you.""    

Sachs-Ericsson co-authored the study, published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, with FSU psychology Professor Thomas Joiner and researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The researchers studied data from 5,614 people ages 15 to 54 - a subset of the National Comorbidity Survey. The average age of the multiethnic sample was 33.    

The findings are significant because of the clear implications for clinical treatment. Research has shown self-critical people can benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy, an approach that helps people identify their irrational thought patterns and replace them with more rational thoughts, Sachs-Ericsson said. In addition, they are taught new behaviors to deal with uncomfortable situations.    

The high percentage of study participants who reported that they were sometimes or often verbally abused by a parent - nearly 30 percent - surprised the researchers, Sachs-Ericsson said. Verbal abuse included insults, swearing, threats of physical abuse and spiteful comments or behavior.    

Parents may have learned this style of parenting from their own parents, or they simply may be unaware of positive ways to motivate or discipline their children, Sachs-Ericsson said. They may also have a psychiatric or  personality disorder  that interferes with their parenting abilities.    

Over time, children believe the negative things they hear, and they begin to use those negative statements as explanations for anything that goes wrong. For instance, a child who does not get invited to a party or does poorly on a test will think the reason is because he or she is no good if that is the message conveyed by a parent. This pattern of self-criticism continues into adulthood and has been shown to make an individual more prone to depression and anxiety.    

To assess self-criticism, researchers asked participants to respond to statements such as, ""I dwell on my mistakes more than I should,"" and ""There is a considerable difference between how I am now and how I would like to be."" Those who had been verbally abused were more likely to be self-critical than those who were not.    

Those who suffered parental physical abuse (6.6 percent) or sexual abuse by a relative or stepparent (4.5 percent) also were more self-critical, but the researchers determined that self-criticism may not have been as important a factor in the development of depression and anxiety for physically and sexually abused participants as it was for those who experienced verbal abuse.    

""Childhood abuse of any type has the potential to influence self-critical tendencies,"" she said. ""Although sexual and physical abuse don't directly supply the critical words like 'you're worthless,' the overall message conveyed by these kinds of abuse clearly does.""

A new study reveals how the production of a potent immune regulator called interferon gamma (IFNg) is controlled in natural killer (NK) cells, immune cells that typically defend the body against  cancer  and infections.    
IFNg, produced by NK cells and other cell types, plays a critical role in killing pathogen-infected cells and in defending against  tumor  cells. However, overproduction of IFNg is also dangerous to the body and can cause autoimmune diseases. But exactly how the body tightly controls IFNg production - and, therefore, NK-cell activity - is not known.    
The study, published in the May issue of the journal Immunity, looked at substances called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which cause NK cells to make IFNg and stimulate their activity. It also looked at transforming growth factor beta (TGFb), a substance also made by NK cells that lowers IFNg production.    
The research, by investigators with the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center - Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that the pro-inflammatory cytokines not only cause NK cells to make IFNg, but they also shut down TGFb signaling, which inhibits production of IFNg.    
That is, the cytokines not only increase some positive regulators of IFNg production, but they also shut down the TGFb signals that inhibit IFNg production.    
In addition, the scientists found that TGFb turns down IFNg production - and, therefore, NK cell activity - both directly and indirectly.    
The direct mechanism turns off the IFNg gene itself. The indirectly mechanism blocks a protein that normally turns up IFNg production.    
\""Our findings provide important details about the fine balance between positive and negative regulators of IFNg production in NK cells,\"" says principal investigator Michael A. Caligiuri, director of the OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center. \""Mother Nature uses a symphony of cytokines that result in exquisitely tight control of its production in the healthy state.    
\""This might help us harness the cancer-killing ability of NK cells to control tumor growth and lead to new treatments that complement current cancer therapy,\"" he says.    
The body carefully regulates IFNg levels. If there is too little of the substance, the risk of infection and cancer rises. If there is too much IFNg, NK cells become too plentiful and autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease can occur.    
\""Our findings explain the yin and yang of the system that controls NK cells,\"" says first author Jianhua Yu, a post-doctoral student in Caligiuri\'s laboratory. \""When NK cells are called into action, the body not only turns up the activation pathway, it also shuts down the anti-activation pathway.\""    
Likewise, when TGFb turns down NK cell activity, it not only turns off the IFNg gene, it also shuts down the pathway that activates the gene.    
\""In each instance, these regulatory cytokines deliver a double whammy,\"" Caligiuri says. \""They turn on what is needed and turn off anything that interferes with it.\""

A World Health Organization adviser is calling for the government to stop food manufacturers and distributors producing and selling unhealthy, cheap, salty junk food.

Francesco Cappuccio, Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine & Epidemiology at the University of Warwick's Warwick Medical School is making the appeal after conducting 30 years of research into the diets of populations around the world.

His latest study has been published in BMJ Open. It indicates that across Europe people of low socio-economic background eat more salt than those on higher incomes - which can contribute to the lower life expectancy seen in these groups.

Professor Cappuccio said: ""The 2010 Marmot Review in the UK and work conducted by the World Health Organization reveal that people from poorer backgrounds not only die sooner but spend more of their lives with disabilities. Inequalities in nutritional and socio-economic status translate ultimately into inequalities in health.

""The government can do something about this by discouraging manufacturers from producing cheap, salty food and distributors from selling them. These are the types of foods consumed by those on lower incomes because they are inexpensive but ultimately they have a detrimental effect on your health.""

The study, the Geographic and socio-economic variation of sodium and potassium intake in Italy, also unearthed a significant north-south divide. Participants living in less affluent southern Italy (e.g. Calabria, Basilicata and Puglia) had significantly higher salt intake than elsewhere. In a previous study Prof. Cappuccio found similar results across Britain where salt intake is higher further north in Scotland compared to more affluent, southern parts of the British Isles. He believes that his latest study demonstrates that social inequalities in salt intake are a Europe-wide problem. 

Despite Italy being renowned for its healthy Mediterranean diet the latest research suggests that people in the poorer areas of the country, mostly in the south, have more salt in their diets than those in the more affluent north, even taking into account factors such as differences in regional cuisine and salt from sources other than diet.

The research examined 3,857 men and women aged between 39-79 years. They were chosen randomly across 20 Italian regions as part of a bigger national cardiovascular survey. The research team measured the amount of sodium in the urine of participants, an indication of salt consumption. They found that across Italy there was an association between salt intake and income and educational attainment. Those in lower skilled jobs had 6.5% more sodium in their urine (high salt consumption) compared to those in top managerial jobs. There was a similar relationship between education as those who were educated to just junior school level ate 5.9% more salt that those with university degrees.

National guidelines advise that adults should eat no more than 6g of salt a day which is approximately equivalent to one teaspoon and children should eat less. Previous studies show that a 5g per day higher salt intake is associated with a 24% higher risk of stroke.

Professor Cappuccio said: ""Dietary salt, primarily sodium chloride, is commonly used for food preservation and seasoning. In most westernised countries, like the UK, approximately 75% of salt consumed is hidden in processed and restaurant foods whereas only about 15% comes from discretionary use such as added at the table or in cooking by the consumer or food handler and 10% from natural sources.

During the past 15 years the British government conducted one of the most successful salt reduction campaigns in the world with an average reduction of salt consumption of 1.5g a day over eight years. However in research published last year Professor Cappuccio demonstrated that there is still social inequality.

He said: ""Since 2010-11, with the introduction of the Responsibility Deal - a sharp policy change making food industries responsible for improving nutrition - the sustained action previously exerted on manufacturers to reformulate their food with less salt has slowed down. This setback will undoubtedly lead to wider health inequalities with worse consequences seen in those groups of society who most of all need effective prevention. We now have convincing evidence in Britain and across Europe that more regulatory actions and mandatory enforcements are needed to deliver a reduced-salt environment for all to benefit from.""

Professor Cappuccio leads research in cardiovascular health at Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick. The group's main interests are the prevention, detection and management of hypertension and its complications, and the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease. The relationships between nutrition, metabolic abnormalities and cardiovascular risk, including risk assessment in ethnic minorities, both in developed and developing countries, are also being studied. Professor Cappuccio is also a Technical Expert on salt for the National Institute of Care and Excellence and the World Health Organization.",0

Unified officials, the  Los Angeles Times  reports (Doan,  Los Angeles Times , 7/24). The Vaccines for Children Program provides no-cost immunizations to children covered by Medicaid, Alaska-native and American Indian children and some uninsured and underinsured children ( Kaiser Daily Women\'s Health Policy Report , 6/30).  FDA  last month  approved  Gardasil for sale and marketing to girls and women ages nine to 26, and  CDC \'s  Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  later that month voted unanimously to recommend that all girls ages 11 and 12 receive the vaccine ( Kaiser Daily Women\'s Health Policy Report , 7/5). ACIP also recommended that Gardasil be covered by the Vaccines for Children Program ( Kaiser Daily Women\'s Health Policy Report , 6/30). Through the vaccine program, Los Angeles County dispenses 16 approved vaccines at no cost to qualified health care providers, including 22 school districts, 80 not-for-profit community clinics and 44 county health services sites. Karen Maiorca, L.A. Unified\'s former director of nursing services, said the vaccine will be available to all students annually at district-operated health clinics, regardless of their eligibility for the Vaccines for Children program. School districts registered for the Vaccines for Children program -- including L.A. Unified,  Hacienda La Puente Unified School District  and  Azusa Unified School District  -- can decide not to offer the vaccine, the  Times  reports. County and L.A. Unified officials said they have not received resistance to the proposal, but the district\'s plans to distribute the vaccine have not yet been made public, according to the  Times . Los Angeles School Board President Marlene Canter said she understood the concerns of some parents who think the vaccine could promote sexual promiscuity among teenagers. \""But the way I see it is you have a chance to prevent a disease that kills people,\"" she said, adding, \""You should look at it as a preventive vaccine that saves lives.\""  Peter Kerndt, director of the county health department\'s sexually transmitted infection program, said he plans to recommend to Los Angeles County supervisors that all teenage females be vaccinated if their parents give permission. Vaccines for Children and Merck are expected to continue cost negotiations for vaccine supplies for at least two more months, and it could be four to six months before the county can distribute the supplies to schools, Kerndt said ( Los Angeles Times , 7/24).

A study of rats given regular, high doses of amphetamine finds that those exposed to the drug at an age corresponding to human adolescence experience long-term changes in brain function that persist into adulthood.

The study, reported in the journal Neuroscience, found that amphetamine leads to changes in dopamine signaling. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in memory, attention, learning and feelings of pleasure.

""The dopamine system, which continues to develop throughout adolescence and young adulthood, is a primary target of psychostimulant drugs like amphetamine,"" said University of Illinois psychology professor Joshua Gulley, who led the new research. ""Changes in dopamine function in response to repeated drug exposure are likely to contribute to the behavioral consequences - addiction and relapse, for example - that abusers experience.""

Parallels between rat and human development make rats a worthy model for the study of human drug addiction, which often begins in adolescence, Gulley said.

""Rats exhibit many of the characteristics that human adolescents do. They tend to be more impulsive than adult rats; they tend to make more risky decisions,"" he said. They also can engage in ""addiction-like behaviors,"" he said.

""They show increased drug use in response to stress,"" Gulley said. ""And, just as in humans, there is evidence that animals that start using drugs in adolescence are more likely to relapse than animals that start in adulthood.""

A limitation of the new study was that, unlike humans, who generally choose whether or not to partake in drug use, ""the rats had no say in whether they got amphetamine,"" Gulley said.

A previous study from Gulley and his colleagues looked at the effects of amphetamine abuse on working memory - the ability to retain information just long enough to use it - in young and adult rats.

""In that study, we found that animals that were exposed to the drug during adolescence had much more significant deficits in working memory than those exposed during adulthood,"" Gulley said.

The researchers hypothesized that drug exposure during adolescence, a time of vast changes in the brain, ""somehow influences the normal developmental trajectory,"" Gulley said. ""But how?""

To get at this question, the team focused on the prefrontal cortex, a brain region behind the forehead that is among the last to fully develop during adolescence. The researchers found that repeated exposure to amphetamine - beginning in adulthood or in adolescence - reduced the ability of key cells in the rats' prefrontal cortex to respond to dopamine. In this part of the brain, dopamine influences ""inhibitory tone,"" telling cells to stop responding to a stimulus, Gulley said.

""Inhibition in the nervous system is just as important as activation,"" he said. ""You need cells that are firing and communicating with one another, but you also need cells to stop communicating with one another at certain times and become quiet.

""Our research suggests that a subtype of dopamine receptor, the D1 receptor, is altered following amphetamine exposure,"" Gulley said. ""It's either not responding to dopamine or there are not as many of these receptors after exposure as there used to be.""

This change in dopamine signaling persisted for 14 weeks after exposure to amphetamine in the adolescent-exposed rats, he said.

""That's akin to a change in humans that persists from adolescence until sometime in their 30s, long after drug use stopped,"" he said.

""Along with other studies, this shows pretty clear evidence that drug use during adolescence, a time when the brain is still developing, has extremely long-lasting consequences that go far beyond the last drug exposure,"" Gulley said.

People with early schizophrenia are at an increased risk of developing diabetes, even when the effects of antipsychotic drugs, diet and exercise are taken out of the equation, according to an analysis by researchers from King's College London.

Schizophrenia is known to be associated with a reduced life expectancy of up to 30 years. This is largely due to physical health disorders such as heart attack or stroke, for which type 2 diabetes is a major risk factor.

People with long-term schizophrenia are three times more likely than the general population to have diabetes, something which has previously been attributed to poor diet and exercise habits in this group, as well as the use of antipsychotic medication.

Published in JAMA Psychiatry, this new study examined whether diabetes risk is already present in people at the onset of schizophrenia, before antipsychotics have been prescribed and before a prolonged period of illness that may be associated with poor lifestyle habits (such as poor diet and sedentary behaviour).

The researchers pooled data from 16 studies comprising 731 patients with a first episode of schizophrenia and 614 people from the general population. They analysed blood tests from these studies and found that patients with schizophrenia showed higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with healthy controls.

Specifically, the patients had higher levels of fasting blood glucose, which is a clinical indicator of diabetes risk. The higher the glucose in your blood, the more likely you are to have diabetes as the body cannot efficiently remove glucose into cells where it can be used as fuel.

They also discovered that compared with healthy controls, patients with first episode schizophrenia had higher levels of insulin and increased levels of insulin resistance, again supporting the notion that this group are at higher risk of developing diabetes.

These results remained significant even when analyses were restricted to studies where patients and controls were matched for dietary intake, the amount of regular exercise they engaged in, and ethnic background. This suggests that the results were not wholly driven by differences in lifestyle factors or ethnicity between the two groups, and may therefore point towards schizophrenia's direct role in increasing risk of diabetes.

The researchers highlight several factors that could increase the likelihood of developing both conditions, including shared genetic risk and evidence of shared developmental risk factors, such as premature birth and low birth-weight. It is also thought that the stress associated with developing schizophrenia, which sees levels of the stress hormone cortisol rise, may also contribute to a higher risk of diabetes.

Dr Toby Pillinger, first author of the study from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King's College London, said: 'The mortality gap between people with schizophrenia and the general population is growing, and there is a need for novel approaches to halt this trend. Our study highlights the importance of considering physical health at the onset of schizophrenia, and calls for a more holistic approach to its management, combining physical and mental healthcare.

'Our findings tell us that people with early schizophrenia have already started down the road to developing diabetes, even if they haven't been diagnosed with diabetes yet.'

Dr Pillinger added: 'Given that some antipsychotic drugs may increase the risk of diabetes further, clinicians have a responsibility to select an appropriate antipsychotic at an appropriate dose. Our results also suggest that patients should be given better education regarding diet and physical exercise, monitoring, and, where appropriate, early lifestyle changes and treatments to combat the risk of diabetes.'

Professor Oliver Howes, senior author of the study from the IoPPN at King's College London, said: 'These findings are a wake-up call that we need to rethink the link between diabetes and schizophrenia and start prevention right from the onset of schizophrenia. It is a case of thinking mind and body right from the start.'

Previous research has indicated that whole grains and high dietary fiber intake have several health benefits, such as for glycemic control and insulin sensitivity. However, scientists have been unable to agree whether whole grains and fiber help to regulate weight.

The grain food group includes rice, oats, wheat, and barley. While whole grains contain the whole-grain kernel and include brown rice, oatmeal, and whole-wheat flour, refined grains are starches that are processed and milled to remove the bran and germ to prolong their shelf life. Examples of refined grains include white rice, white bread, and white flour.

Milling empties the starch of dietary fiber, iron, and B vitamins. Although iron and B vitamins can be added back into the refined grains, the fiber is not often reintroduced.

In the new research, investigators conducted a study over 8 weeks that included 81 men and women aged between 40 and 65. All food was provided to the participants over the course of the study and included either whole grains or refined grains. Participants were asked only to consume the food provided, return any uneaten food, and continue with their usual levels of physical activity.

""We provided all food to ensure that the composition of the diets differed only in grain source,"" says senior author Susan B. Roberts, Ph.D., senior scientist and director of the Energy Metabolism Laboratory at the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging.

For the first 2 weeks, all participants ate the same type of food, and the calorie needs of each individual were determined. The participants were then randomly assigned to either a group that included whole grains or a group with refined grains.

The differences between the whole-grain diet and refined-grain diet were mostly in grain and fiber content. Type of food, meal structure, and energy and macronutrient composition were similar in both groups.

The researchers compared the effects of whole grains and refined grains on resting metabolic rate and fecal energy losses, in addition to how full or how hungry the participants felt. Measures of the study included weight, metabolic rate, blood glucose, fecal calories, hunger, and fullness. 

Results showed that the group that ate whole grains had increased resting metabolic rate and greater fecal losses compared with the refined grain group. Furthermore, the increases in fecal energy losses were not because of the extra fiber, but from the effect of the fiber on the digestibility of other food calories.

Participants who consumed whole grains - an amount that matched the recommended daily allowance for fiber - lost almost an extra 100 calories per day than the participants who consumed refined grains without much fiber.

""The extra calories lost by those who ate whole grains was equivalent of a brisk 30-minute walk - or enjoying an extra small cookie every day in terms of its impact,"" says Roberts. 

Roberts' colleagues included Phil J. Karl, Ph.D., first author of the study, an alumnus of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts, and a nutrition scientist at the United States Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine in Natick, MA.

""Many previous studies have suggested benefits of whole grains and dietary fiber on chronic disease risk. This study helps to quantify how whole grains and fiber work to benefit weight management, and lend credibility to previously reported associations between increased whole grains and fiber consumption, lower body weight and better health.""
Phil J. Karl
The study used commercially available products that used whole-grain flour. The team hypothesizes that using foods with whole-grain kernels might affect metabolic rate and fecal loss further. Fullness, hunger, and diet satisfaction did not appear to differ significantly between the two diets.

Study co-author Eran Elinav, of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, and colleagues publish their findings in the journal Nature.

The United States is in the midst of an obesity epidemic, with more than 1 in 3 adults and 1 in 6 children and adolescents considered obese.

While adopting a healthy diet is considered a key weight loss strategy for individuals who are overweight or obese, very few people are able to achieve long-term weight loss.

Elinav and team note that up to 80 percent of people who initially lose weight with dieting will regain their lost weight - and sometimes gain even more - within 12 months. 

This weight loss and regain can occur in cycles - a phenomenon known as the ""yo-yo effect"" or ""weight cycling,"" which studies have shown can carry significant health risks. A recent study reported by Medical News Today, for example, found that yo-yo dieting can increase the risk of death from heart disease. 

But exactly why do so many individuals have trouble losing weight and keeping it off? New research suggests it may be down to changes in the gut microbiome - the abundance of microorganisms in the intestine - in response to dieting.

Elinav and colleagues used a mouse model of recurrent obesity to reach their findings, whereby they repeatedly fed the rodents high amounts of fat, followed by normal chow, which triggered cycles of weight loss and weight gain.

""As observed in recurrently dieting humans, a preceding obesity-weight loss cycle rendered mice susceptible to accelerated secondary weight gain, even after fully returning to baseline weight,"" note the authors.

""As a result, the net weight gain, i.e. the weight induced during identical durations of high-fat feeding, was higher in the weight cycling group as compared to mice continuously fed an HFD [high-fat diet],"" they add.

On assessing the gut microbiomes of the mice, the researchers identified specific alterations in response to the high-fat diet, and these remained even after the mice lost weight with the normal-chow diet.

Interestingly, when the rodents were reintroduced to the high-fat diet, the researchers found that the altered gut microbiome appeared to speed up their weight regain.

To test their findings further, the team transferred the altered gut microbiome to mice that had not been exposed to yo-yo dieting, but which were subsequently exposed to a high-fat diet. 

Compared with control mice, the rodents with the altered gut microbiome experienced faster and greater weight gain.

On further investigation, the researchers found that the altered gut microbiome played a role in reducing levels of two flavonoids -  apigenin and naringenin - in response to dieting, which are plant compounds that boast a number of health benefits.

What is more, the team found that this reduction in flavonoids interfered with expression of UCP-1 - a gene that plays a role in energy expenditure, or the amount of calories we burn. It is this process, the researchers speculate, that likely drives recurrent weight gain.

The researchers say their findings suggest a ""post-biotic"" therapy may be effective against weight regain after dieting, whereby flavonoids are introduced to the gut to replenish those lost by dieting. This strategy was found to be effective in mice, the team reports.

While further research is needed to determine whether such a strategy would be effective in humans, the authors believe their results hold promise:
""Together, our data highlight a possible microbiome contribution to accelerated post-dieting weight regain, and suggest that microbiome-targeting approaches may help to diagnose and treat this common disorder.""

The slight increase in risk of developing type 2 diabetes during statin treatment may actually be a consequence of having lowered cholesterol, rather than a direct effect of the drug, according to research funded by the British Heart Foundation. The genetic study found that people with genes predisposing them to having lower levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, had a decreased risk of heart disease and an increased risk of diabetes.

The researchers, from UCL and the University of Oxford, used large data sets of genetic information to investigate the possible effects of two types of cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and a form of dietary fat known as triglycerides, on a person's risk of developing heart disease and diabetes.

In order to see whether blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels were linked with heart disease and diabetes risk, the researchers compared heart disease and diabetes rates in people with and without naturally occurring variations in genes known to affect the levels of cholesterol and triglycerides within their blood.

The researchers found that individuals with genetic variations that increase their LDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels were at an increased risk of heart disease. They also found that individuals with genetic variations increasing their LDL or HDL cholesterol, and possibly triglyceride levels, were at a slightly decreased risk of having diabetes.

The results of this study, published in the journal JAMA Cardiology, confirm findings from many previous studies which have shown that increased levels of LDL cholesterol increase a person's likelihood of suffering from a heart attack or stroke. They also go some way to explaining why previous studies have shown that there is a modest increase in the risk of developing diabetes amongst people taking statins. However, it is well known that the protective effect of statins on heart disease and stroke substantially outweigh this modest increase in risk of diabetes. The researchers confirm that clinical guidelines around statin usage should not change, but doctors should be vigilant in monitoring patients for risk of developing diabetes.

Further research is now needed to uncover exactly how an increase in LDL cholesterol in the blood protects against diabetes whilst increasing a person's risk of suffering from heart disease.

Dr Michael Holmes, Senior Clinical Research Fellow from the University of Oxford, who led the research, said:
""What we've shown in this study is that the role played by blood lipid levels in disease is a complex one. While the effect of taking LDL cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins may slightly increase a person's risk of developing diabetes this effect is greatly outweighed by their benefits in the form of preventing people from suffering from a life-altering heart attack or stroke.

""This study has provided yet more evidence that having increased HDL cholesterol may not be beneficial to heart disease. Of novel interest, our findings suggest that there could be a potential role for therapies that increase HDL cholesterol in the treatment and prevention of diabetes.""

Professor Jeremy Pearson, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, which funded the research, said:

""This carefully conducted large scale genetic study reports several novel and interesting results on the relationships between levels of different blood lipids and the risk of developing heart disease or diabetes. 

""One key finding is that patients with naturally lower LDL cholesterol levels, similar to those taking a statin, have a slightly increased risk of diabetes, indicating that the risk is related to LDL levels and not to any separate effect of the statin itself."" ",0

The study, published in Appetite, compared the reward response to romantic cues in women with a history of dieting to non-dieters.

""We found that young women both with and without a history of dieting had greater brain activation in response to romantic pictures in reward-related neural regions after having eaten than when hungry,"" reports first author Alice Ely, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of California-San Diego School of Medicine.

Earlier studies had indicated that people are often more sensitive to rewarding stimuli such as food, money and drugs when they are hungry. However, this was not the case in the new study.

""This data suggests that eating may prime or sensitize young women to rewards beyond food,"" says Ely. ""It also supports a shared neurocircuitry for food and sex.""

Ely and her colleagues at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA, had previously conducted a pilot study - published in Obesity - among college-age women that examined how the brain is affected by food cues, and whether these responses differed between historical dieters and non-dieters.

They discovered that women with a history of dieting responded more dramatically to positive food cues (such as chocolate cake) than those who had never dieted or were currently following a diet.

Historical dieters have been identified as being more at risk for weight gain, and so the researchers concluded that the area of their brains that is associated with reward may be more predisposed to desire food than those who had never dieted.

Due to these findings, Ely and colleagues hypothesized that historical dieters are differentially sensitive to rewarding stimuli in general, and decided to test their theory by looking at brain activation when viewing romantic pictures compared with neutral stimuli in both fasted and fed states.

Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the researchers discovered that among both historical dieters and non-dieters, the reward-related brain circuitry responded more to romantic cues after having eaten.

However, the neural activity in one region of the historical dieters' brains was significantly different to that observed in the non-dieters brains. Historical dieters were more responsive to romantic cues in the superior frontal gyrus when fasted and in the middle temporal gyrus when fed.

""The pattern of response was similar to historical dieters' activation when viewing highly palatable food cues, and is consistent with research showing overlapping brain-based responses to sex, drugs and food,"" Ely concludes.

According to the Boston Medical Center, an estimated 45 million Americans diet each year and yet, despite this, nearly two thirds of Americans are overweight or obese. Could neurological factors play a part in the prevalence of obesity?

Last month, Medical News Today reported on a study that found women who survive breast cancer are more likely to gain weight over the following years than women who have not had cancer, with survivors gaining an average of 3.6 lb more in weight.

Restaurants should offer tap water to families dining out, so children have an alternative to a sugary drink, say councils.
 
The Local Government Association, which represents more than 370 councils with responsibility for public health, says tap water needs to be made more freely available, rather than something you have to ask for.
 
It wants the Government to use its forthcoming childhood obesity strategy as an opportunity to encourage restauranteurs to take responsibility and offer parents and children the choice of tap water as an alternative drink.
  
One-in-five people do not know that licenced premises have to provide free tap water by law. Many restaurants however, currently only do so on request.
  
Council leaders want restaurant owners and chains to step up and give tap water without customers feeling the need to ask for it.
  
This comes as figures show most people don't ask for tap water when they eat out.
  
Eight out of 10 people usually drink tap water at home, yet only a third do so when eating out at restaurants.
  
The same survey also found that 15 per cent of people who usually drink tap water at home, never think of asking for water in cafes or restaurants, while 13 per cent said it made them feel awkward.
  
The LGA wants government to promote initiatives where children are encouraged to drink more water in the childhood obesity strategy, and has previously called for tap water to be made more freely available in schools, nurseries and children's centres.
  
Cllr Izzi Seccombe, LGA Community Wellbeing spokeswoman, said:
  
""We want restaurant owners to play their part in tackling childhood obesity by offering families tap water.
 
""While most restaurants will happily provide a glass of tap water on request, we're saying it shouldn't be something you have to ask for. Some people may be too embarrassed or find it awkward to ask for tap water. Others may simply forget it's an option.
  
""Water brings important health benefits and keeps people hydrated. For children it's an alternative to a sugary drink, while for adults it might dissuade them from ordering another alcoholic drink.""
 
Brighton and Hove has pledged to become a Sugar Smart City, with the ambition of reducing people's sugar intake to tackle obesity. As part of this, cafés, restaurants and takeaways have agreed to make water more freely available.

The International Journal of Epidemiology finds that three widely cited research studies relating to mass deworming in Africa have substantial problems in their methods and analysis. The original researchers claimed that their results show long-term effectiveness of these mass deworming programmes in developing countries, but this critical analysis concludes that the findings are unlikely to be as positive as previous researchers have reported.

Millions of children in some of the poorest areas of the world are infected with intestinal worms. The infections can impair appetite and cause anaemia in individual children. For many years, parasitologists, economists and development specialists have laid great faith in community control programmes of mass drug administration. The aim is to eliminate the worms and thus improve nutrition, health, education and thus materially contribute to the economic development through higher incomes. Recent independent critical appraisal from the Cochrane and Campbell Collaborations have shown that the short-term benefits appear to have been exaggerated. This new research carefully appraises the few studies examining long-term effects.

The researchers applied current day methods of appraisal to the three follow-up studies carried out nine years after a trial in Kenya and a second in Uganda had been completed. The original authors sought to identify the long-term effects of short additional exposures to deworming programmes in settings where the children were then all dewormed multiple times. The researchers examined school attendance, appetite and wage earning nine years later; another study looked at the spin-off effects of deworming the community on very young children. Whilst the original authors found strong positive effects, the appraisal showed that the authors had not used pre-planned protocols and the studies were at high risk of reporting bias and selective reporting of favorable results.

The senior author of this new analysis, Professor Paul Garner, from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine's Centre for Evidence Synthesis in Global Health, said: ""When we apply international standards for epidemiological methodological rigor in these studies, unfortunately they don't pass muster.. Multiple significance testing and then selection of supportive results seems to be a potential problem. This is an example from the field of development economics where bias needs to be taken into account before the authors make policy recommendations.""

A survey of more than 216,000 adolescents from all 50 states indicates the number of teens with marijuana-related problems is declining. Similarly, the rates of marijuana use by young people are falling despite the fact more U.S. states are legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana use and the number of adults using the drug has increased.

Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis examined data on drug use collected from young people, ages 12 to 17, over a 12-year span. They found that the number of adolescents who had problems related to marijuana - such as becoming dependent on the drug or having trouble in school and in relationships - declined by 24 percent from 2002 to 2013.

Over the same period, kids, when asked whether they had used pot in the previous 12 months, reported fewer instances of marijuana use in 2013 than their peers had reported in 2002. In all, the rate fell by 10 percent.

Those drops were accompanied by reductions in behavioral problems, including fighting, property crimes and selling drugs. The researchers found that the two trends are connected. As kids became less likely to engage in problem behaviors, they also became less likely to have problems with marijuana.

The study's first author, Richard A. Grucza, PhD, an associate professor of psychiatry, explained that those behavioral problems often are signs of childhood psychiatric disorders.

""We were surprised to see substantial declines in marijuana use and abuse,"" he said. ""We don't know how legalization is affecting young marijuana users, but it could be that many kids with behavioral problems are more likely to get treatment earlier in childhood, making them less likely to turn to pot during adolescence. But whatever is happening with these behavioral issues, it seems to be outweighing any effects of marijuana decriminalization.""

The new study is published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry.

The data was gathered as part of a confidential, computerized study called the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. It surveys young people from different racial, ethnic and income groups in all 50 states about their drug use, abuse and dependence.

In 2002, just over 16 percent of those 12 to 17 reported using marijuana during the previous year. That number fell to below 14 percent by 2013. Meanwhile, the percentage of young people with marijuana-use disorders declined from around 4 percent to about 3 percent.

At the same time, the number of kids in the study who reported having serious behavior problems - such as getting into fights, shoplifting, bringing weapons to school or selling drugs - also declined over the 12-year study period.

""Other research shows that psychiatric disorders earlier in childhood are strong predictors of marijuana use later on,"" Grucza said. ""So it's likely that if these disruptive behaviors are recognized earlier in life, we may be able to deliver therapies that will help prevent marijuana problems - and possibly problems with alcohol and other drugs, too.""

For many American children, eating out is routine.

Studies show that, while home-prepared food has more nutritional value than restaurant meals, the diets of most children in the US already lack fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy items.

The options available in restaurants, meanwhile, often contain excess calories, solid fats, sodium and added sugar.

Many restaurants have already begun offering healthier choices for children, in anticipation of legislation that will require calorie counts to be included on menus from December 2016.

For the past 6 years, healthier children's dishes have been among the top 10 food trends in the National Restaurant Association's annual survey of chefs.

In 2011, the National Restaurant Association introduced a voluntary program called ""Kids Live Well,"" aimed at helping parents and children make healthier choices when eating out. 

The 42,000 participating restaurants now offer at least one meal and one side dish that meet specific criteria for nutrition. Full meals must include at least two, and side dishes at least one of the following food groups: fruits, vegetables, lower-fat dairy, whole grains and lean protein.

However, there is still a way to go.

Researchers led by Dr. Sarah Sliwa, PhD, of Tufts University Friedman School of Nutrition in Boston, MA, wanted to find out how children's meals match up to national nutritional recommendations.

The authors used the 2014 Nation's Restaurant News Top 100 Report to select outlets for the study. They identified the top 10 quick-service restaurants (QSR) and full-service restaurants (FSR) that offered a kids' menu, had publicly available nutrition information and provided calorie information for all children's entrees.

They then compared calories, fat, saturated fat and sodium from children's meal combinations with national dietary recommendations.

Results showed that 72% of the meal combinations at the QSRs and 63% of those at the FSRs followed national guidelines for calories. However, fewer than 1 in 3 meal combinations at QSRs and 1 in 4 at FSRs met the guidelines for calories, saturated fat and sodium. Most meals contained more than the recommended amount of sodium.

Nevertheless, 90% of meal combinations at two of the QSRs had less than 770 mg of sodium, proving that it is feasible for large, successful restaurant chains to meet this requirement.

Dr. Sliwa says:
""Improving the availability of healthier kids' meals is a critical step toward increasing children's exposure to healthier foods, but that alone is not enough. We encourage restaurants to look holistically at the nutritional value of their children's meals, and to market healthier options in ways that emphasize taste and appeal to parents and children alike.""
Senior author Christina Economos, PhD, who is vice chair and director of ChildObesity180, says that while we should commend restaurants on their progress, there is still a long way to go.

The authors predict that when calorie counts start appearing on more menus later this year, calories may decrease further. However, what impact menu labeling will have on areas such as sodium content is unclear.

Economos does not believe that any one step will reverse the obesity epidemic, and she calls for everyone to pull together to ensure a healthier diet for children.

Restaurants can increase the prevalence and prominence of attractive, healthy options, but parents also have a role to educate and encourage their children to make healthier choices. Economos urges parents to speak up and demand healthy meals where there are none.

""We need to combine more nutritious children's meal offerings with stronger education to drive both supply and demand to support healthier choices,"" she says.

Medical News Today recently reported that many restaurants are serving oversized, high-calorie meals, with 92% of meals containing more calories than guidelines recommend.

An interdisciplinary team of scientists at the Helmholtz Zentrum München has studied the metabolism of women with gestational diabetes after giving birth. Along with partners at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), they were able to show that breastfeeding for more than three months brings about long-term metabolic changes. The research findings have been published in the journal Diabetologia.

Four percent of all pregnant women in Germany develop gestational diabetes before the birth of their child. Although their blood sugar levels initially return to normal after delivery, one in two of the mothers affected develops type 2 diabetes within the next ten years. While it has been shown that lactation can lower this risk by 40 percent, the reasons for this are not yet understood.

In an earlier study, researchers led by Professor Anette-Gabriele Ziegler, Director of the Institute of Diabetes Research (IDF) at the Helmholtz Zentrum München, showed that breastfeeding for more than three months postpartum has a protective effect, which lasts for up to 15 years after gestational diabetes. In their most recent study, they examined whether the metabolism could be responsible for this.

For their analyses, the scientists examined almost 200 patients who had developed gestational diabetes. The participants in the study received a standardized glucose solution and gave a fasting blood sample beforehand, and during the test. The scientists then compared the samples on the basis of 156 different, known metabolites. On average, the women had given birth three and half years earlier.

""We observed that the metabolites in women who had breastfed for more than three months differed significantly from those who had had shorter lactation periods,"" first-author Dr. Daniela Much from the IDF reports. ""Longer periods of lactation are linked to a change in the production of phospholipids and to lower concentrations of branched-chain amino acids in the mothers' blood plasma."" This is interesting because the metabolites involved were linked in earlier studies with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, the authors say.

""The findings of our study provide new insights into disease-related metabolic pathways that are influenced by lactation and could thus be the underlying reason for the protective effect,"" concludes Dr. Sandra Hummel, head of the Gestational Diabetes working group at the IDF, who led the study. Breastfeeding, she explains, is a cost-effective intervention which aims to reduce the long-term risk of developing type 2 diabetes among women with gestational diabetes.

In the future, the scientists will look at ways of translating this knowledge into concrete treatment recommendations. ""On average, women with gestational diabetes breastfeed less often and for shorter duration than non-diabetic mothers,"" Hummel says. ""The aim is now to develop strategies that will improve the breastfeeding behaviors of mothers with gestational diabetes.""

Citrus fruits contain several antioxidants that may prevent a range of health concerns. According to a recent article exploring the health benefits of popular foods, citrus fruits may lower ischemic stroke risk, maintain blood pressure, and support heart health.

Fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants called flavonoids, which are the largest group of phytonutrients - plant chemicals - with more than 6,000 types. Phytonutrients along with carotenoids are responsible for the vivid colors of fruits and vegetables.

There are several groups of flavonoids, including anthocyanidins, flavanols, flavones, flavanones and isoflavones. Flavanones, such as hesperidin, eriocitrin, and eriodictyol, are abundant in citrus fruits and have been associated with lowering oxidative stress in vitro and animal models. 

""Our results indicate that in the future we can use citrus flavanones, a class of antioxidants, to prevent or delay chronic diseases caused by obesity in humans,"" says Paula S. Ferreira, a graduate student with the research team.

The investigators are presenting the results of the study at the 252nd National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS).

According to the CDC, more than one third of all adults in the United States are obese. Obesity is a significant factor in increasing the risk of developing heart disease, liver disease, and type 2 diabetes, potentially due to oxidative stress and inflammation Ferreira explains. 

Consuming a high-fat diet leads to an accumulation of fat in the human body. Fat cells produce excessive reactive oxygen species, which can damage cells. 

While the body can fight off oxidative stress molecules with antioxidants, obese patients have enlarged fat cells, which can lead to higher levels of oxidative stress that overwhelms the body's ability to counteract them.

Ferreira and colleagues aimed to observe the effects of citrus flavanones on mice with no genetic modifications that were fed a high-fat diet.

The team, at Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP) in Brazil, treated 50 mice with flavanones - hesperidin, eriocitrin, and eriodictyol - found in oranges, lemons, and limes.

The mice were split into categories, and over the course of a month, were fed a standard diet, a high-fat diet, a high-fat diet plus hesperidin, a high-fat diet plus eriocitrin, or a high-fat diet plus eriodictyol. 

Compared with the standard diet, the high-fat non-flavanone diet raised levels of cell-damage markers - thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) - by 80 percent in the blood and 57 percent in the liver of the mice.

However, hesperidin, eriocitrin, and eriodictyol decreased levels of TBARS in the liver by 50 percent, 57 percent, and 64 percent, respectively, when compared with the high-fat non-flavanone diet. Mice treated with hesperidin and eriodictyol also had reduced fat accumulation and damage in the liver.

As with the results in the liver, eriocitrin and eriodictyol reduced TBARS levels in the blood by 48 percent and 47 percent, respectively, in mice on the high-fat non-flavanone diet.

""Our studies did not show any weight loss due to the citrus flavanones,"" says Thais B. Cesar, Ph.D., who leads the team. ""However, even without helping the mice lose weight, they made them healthier with lower oxidative stress, less liver damage, lower blood lipids and lower blood glucose.""

""This study also suggests that consuming citrus fruits probably could have beneficial effects for people who are not obese, but have diets rich in fats, putting them at risk of developing cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and abdominal obesity.""
Paula S. Ferreira
Future studies will explore the best ways to administer the flavanones comparing delivery through fruit juice, consuming fruits, or developing an antioxidant pill. The team also plans to move on from mouse studies to human studies.

354,257352,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/299071.php,Health risks of saturated fats aggravated by immune response,Obesity / Weight Loss / Fitness,Obesity / Weight Loss / Fitness,Lupus,Nutrition / Diet,,3,4,1,4,3,3,5,4,3,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,,"High levels of saturated fat in the blood could make an individual more prone to inflammation and tissue damage, a new study suggests.

Received wisdom on the health risks of eating saturated fat has been called into question recently. This new research supports the view that excessive consumption of saturated fat can be bad for us.

Scientists from Imperial College London studied mice that have an unusually high level of saturated fat circulating in their blood. The research, published 3 September 2015 in Cell Reports shows that the presence of saturated fats resulted in monocytes - a type of white blood cell - migrating into the tissues of vital organs.

The researchers believe that the newly arrived monocytes could worsen tissue damage because they may exacerbate ongoing or underlying inflammation, but this aspect is still under study.

Lead researcher Dr Kevin Woollard said: ""The mice we studied were treated with a drug that caused them to accumulate extremely high levels of fat in their blood. Although it is unusual, humans do sometimes have measurements approaching those levels, either from an inherited condition, or through eating fatty foods.

""Modern lifestyles seem to go hand-in-hand with high levels of fat in the blood. This fat comes from the food and drink that we consume; for example, you'd be surprised how much saturated fat a latte contains, and some people drink several through the course of the day.

""We think that maintaining a relatively high concentration of saturated fats for example by constantly snacking on cakes, biscuits, and pastries could be causing monocytes to migrate out of the blood and into surrounding tissues.""

Blood is very finely balanced, and the exchange of cells and other substances with the surrounding tissue is part of maintaining that balance.

The team, led by Dr Woollard and Professor Marina Botto from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, has observed that as the organs take in fats, most of the migrated monocytes are turned into another type of immune cell called a macrophage and some of the cells located within the tissues take in fat and are turned into 'foam cells'. These foam cells and macrophages then stimulate production of a signalling molecule called CCL4, which attracts more monocytes into the tissue. This spiral continues as long as the level of saturated fat is elevated.

These mechanisms may have evolved to remove fats from the blood in order to maintain a healthy balance; further research is required to confirm this.

A critical discovery, however, is that the monocytes that are involved in this balancing act are of just one very specific type.

Dr Woollard said: ""It's really exciting to see that the monocytes that migrate into tissues are all of one type and that means we actually may be able to develop drugs that change this behaviour.""

In the future, people who are at risk of cardiovascular disease or who are obese could be treated with a therapeutic drug that targets these particular monocytes and prevents the possible future damage caused by fatty build up in their blood vessels and organs.

""Interestingly, people with certain immune disorders affecting monocytes, including some inflammatory and autoimmune diseases like lupus, can have unexpectedly high levels of saturated fats in their blood and also are more likely to suffer heart attacks and strokes at a younger age.""

The next stages of this research will be to study groups of patients with inflammatory diseases, and to look at the direct effects of saturated foods on monocyte function.

Drugs used to treat diabetes could also be used to treat Alzheimer's disease, and vice versa, according to new research from the University of Aberdeen.

This is also the first study of its kind to show that Alzheimer's disease can lead to diabetes, as opposed to diabetes occurring first as was previously thought.

The study reports that Alzheimer's Disease and type 2 diabetes are so closely related that drugs currently used to control glucose levels in diabetes may also alleviate the symptoms and progression of Alzheimer's disease.

The paper, published in the journal Diabetologia (the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes), found for the first time that dementia-related complications within the brain can also lead to changes in glucose handling and ultimately diabetes. This is contrary to what was previously thought - that diabetes begins with a malfunction in the pancreas or a high fat, high sugar diet.

The research was led by Professor Bettina Platt who formed a unique collaboration between her Alzheimer's research team and the diabetes research team led by Professor Mirela Delibegovic. The teams were keen to investigate why the two diseases are so commonly found together in elderly patients.

The researchers developed a model of Alzheimer's disease and were surprised to find that increased levels of a gene involved in the production of toxic proteins in the brain not only led to Alzheimer's -like symptoms, but also to the development of diabetic complications.

Professor Platt said of her research: ""Many people are unaware of the relationship between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, but the fact is that around 80% of people with Alzheimer's disease also have some form of diabetes or disturbed glucose metabolism. This is hugely relevant as Alzheimer's is in the vast majority of cases not inherited, and lifestyle factors and comorbidities must therefore be to blame.

""Our research teams are particularly interested in the impact of lifestyle related factors in dementia and by collaborating with experts in diabetes and metabolism, we have been able to investigate the nature of the link in great detail.

""Until now, we always assumed that obese people get type 2 diabetes and then are more likely to get dementia - we now show that actually it also works the other way around.

""Additionally, it was previously believed that diabetes starts in the periphery, i.e. the pancreas and liver, often due to consumption of an unhealthy diet, but here we show that dysregulation in the brain can equally lead to development of very severe diabetes - so again showing that diabetes doesn't necessarily have to start with your body getting fat - it can start with changes in the brain.

""This study provides a new therapeutic angle into Alzheimer's disease and we now think that some of the compounds that are used for obesity and diabetic deregulation might potentially be beneficial for Alzheimer's patients as well. The good news is that there are a number of new drugs available right now which we are testing to see if they would reverse both Alzheimer's and diabetes symptoms. We will also be able to study whether new treatments developed for Alzheimer's can improve both, the diabetic and cognitive symptoms.""

Acute respiratory tract infections are responsible for 10 percent of ambulance and emergency room visits in the United States.

Including anything from the common cold to pneumonia and bronchitis, they were the cause of an estimated 2.65 million deaths globally in 2013.

Respiratory tract infections have a wide array of risk factors, including overcrowding, a damp living environment, air pollution, and parental smoking. 

A number of observational studies have also reported a nutritional risk factor - vitamin D deficiency. Some researchers have concluded that vitamin D has the ability to trigger an immune response to certain viruses and bacteria.

However, the links between respiratory tract infections and vitamin D supplementation have remained controversial; some studies support the theory while others are inconclusive. To date, five meta-analyses have been conducted on existing data. Two of these reported significant positive effects, and three found no significant effect.

In an attempt to put this question to bed, the largest meta-analysis to date was published this week in the BMJ. 

The analysis, carried out by an international group of researchers, is the first to use individual participant data (IPD), rather than the aggregate methodology that was used in earlier meta-analyses. In this way, changes measured at different points in time within each participant of each trial can be accounted for, rather than taking a summary (aggregate) of the data. IPD is considered the ""gold standard"" of systematic review.

The team used data from 25 randomized controlled trials investigating vitamin D supplementation. In total, data from 11,321 participants were analyzed.

After adjusting for potentially confounding variables, such as sex, age, and study duration, they found that vitamin D supplementation produced a 12 percent reduction in the proportion of individuals experiencing at least one acute respiratory tract infection. 

In simple terms, if 33 people took vitamin D supplements, one acute respiratory tract infection would be prevented. If these results are confirmed, vitamin D supplementation could potentially prevent millions of respiratory infections each year.

When the team drilled further into the data, they found that the positive effect was more pronounced in participants who took daily or weekly vitamin D without additional large doses. The effect was also stronger for individuals with more severe vitamin D deficiencies - only 1 in 4 people in this group would need to take vitamin D regularly to prevent one acute respiratory tract infection.

The authors concluded that:
""Our results add to the body of evidence supporting the introduction of public health measures such as food fortification to improve vitamin D status, particularly in settings where profound vitamin D deficiency is common.""
The team also concluded that vitamin D was safe to consume as a supplement; side effects were rare.

Although the thorough statistical methodology and large group of participants give the findings a degree of strength, there are limitations and some researchers remain unconvinced of the effect. 

In an editorial published in the same journal, Mark Bolland from the University of Auckland in New Zealand and Alison Avenell from the University of Aberdeen in the United Kingdom, write that the results are ""heterogeneous and not sufficiently applicable to the general population. We think that they should be viewed as hypothesis-generating only, requiring confirmation in well-designed adequately powered randomized controlled trials.""

The editorial also states that: 

""Current evidence does not support the use of vitamin D supplementation to prevent disease, except for those at high risk of osteomalacia (weak bones and muscles due to low blood vitamin D levels, currently defined as less than 25 nanomoles per liter).""

Although the jury remains out, the recent findings have added fuel to the fire. If further trials back up the hypothesis, vitamin D supplementation could provide a cost-effective way of reducing the number of acute respiratory infections on a global basis.

Sleep deprivation may result in people consuming more calories during the following day, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis led by researchers at King's College London.

The meta analysis combined the results of many previous small intervention studies to produce a more robust answer and found that sleep-deprived people consumed an average of 385 kcal per day extra, which is equivalent to the calories of about four and a half slices of bread.

The study, published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, combined the results of 11 studies with a total of 172 participants. The analysis included studies that compared a partial sleep restriction intervention with an unrestricted sleep control and measured the individuals' energy intake over the next 24 hours.

They found partial sleep deprivation did not have a significant effect on how much energy people expended in the subsequent 24 hours. Therefore, participants had a net energy gain of 385 calories per day.

The researchers also found there was a small shift in what sleep deprived people ate - they had proportionately higher fat and lower protein intakes, but no change in carbohydrate intake.

Dr Gerda Pot, senior author from the Diabetes & Nutritional Sciences Division at King's College London and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, said: 'The main cause of obesity is an imbalance between calorie intake and expenditure and this study adds to accumulating evidence that sleep deprivation could contribute to this imbalance. So there may be some truth in the saying 'early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy and wise'. This study found that partial sleep deprivation resulted in a large net increased energy intake of 385 kcal per day. If long-term sleep deprivation continues to result in an increased calorie intake of this magnitude, it may contribute to weight gain.

'Reduced sleep is one of the most common and potentially modifiable health risks in today's society in which chronic sleep loss is becoming more common. More research is needed to investigate the importance of long-term, partial sleep deprivation as a risk factor for obesity and whether sleep extension could play a role in obesity prevention.'

A previous small study in 26 adults found partial sleep deprivation resulted in greater activation of areas in the brain associated with reward when people were exposed to food. A greater motivation to seek food could be an explanation for the increased food intake seen in sleep deprived people in this study, the authors suggest. Other possible explanations include a disruption of the internal body clock affecting the body's regulation of leptin (the 'satiety' hormone) and ghrelin (the 'hunger' hormone).

The amount of sleep restriction varied between the studies, with the sleep deprived participants sleeping between three and a half and five and a half hours in the night. The control subjects spent between seven and 12 hours in bed.

The authors suggest that more intervention studies are needed into the effect of increased sleep duration over longer periods in everyday life on weight gain and obesity, as most of the studies included in this analysis were in controlled laboratory conditions over periods of one day to two weeks.

Haya Al Khatib, lead author and PhD candidate at King's College London, said: 'Our results highlight sleep as a potential third factor, in addition to diet and exercise, to target weight gain more effectively. We are currently conducting a randomised controlled trial in habitually short sleepers to explore the effects of sleep extension on indicators of weight gain.'

UroToday.com - Men in the armed forces who served in Vietnam may have been exposed to Agent Orange, the defoliate that potentially is associated with causing  prostate cancer  (CaP).  If so, the correlation between Vietnam service and CaP is present, but not in a statistically significantly manner according to a report by Dr. Leavy and colleagues that appears in the March, 2006 online issue of BMC Public Health.    

Between 2001 and 2002, 606 men with CaP from Western Australia were qualified to participate in a case-control study.  They completed a self-administered questionnaire on personal demographics, family  cancer  history, screening history and occupational history.  A military history was also obtained.  The data was compared to case-matched control men obtained from the Electoral Roll.    

A family history for CaP had a significant positive association with CaP, increasing the risk 2-fold.  A history of military service did not increase the risk of developing CaP, although a specific history of serving in Vietnam did increase the risk but not to a statistically significant level.    

This study used a population-based cancer registry and pathologically-confirmed cases of CaP.  While an association between service in Vietnam and CaP was found, lack of statistical significance may reflect the low response rate of 64% among eligible cases.

Marriage provides greater psychological benefits to depressed people compared to people who are not depressed before they walk down the aisle, a new study reveals. This remains true even though marriage quality is poorer for depressed individuals.    


Adrianne Frech and Kristi Williams, Ph.D. from Ohio State University in Columbus co-wrote the study. It appears in the June issue of the  Journal of Health and Social Behavior .   

""Based on previous research, we hypothesized that people who are depressed would have worse marital quality and would therefore experience fewer benefits from marriage,"" Frech said, ""but that is not what we found.""   

The researchers speculate that marriage might provide a level of companionship that depressed singles typically lack.   

Frech's team used data from the National Survey of Families and Households. The study included 3,066 unmarried people aged 55 years and under. To identify depressed individuals, researchers used a 12-item test for  depression  and considered respondents depressed if they scored 23 or more points on the test.   

After a follow-up period of five years, researchers identified people who married during the period, asked about the quality of their marriages and how their psychological well-being changed. The study excluded participants who married but ended up divorcing before the five-year follow-up.   

Researchers found that the participants who married within the five-year period scored an average of about 3.5 points lower on the depression test than those who remained single. Of all the depressed participants, those who got married scored an average 7.5 points lower on the mood scale than the people who remained single. The non-depressed experienced a smaller change in their psychological well-being if they got married.   

Results from the study confirmed that depressed people report less marital happiness and more marital conflict. Nevertheless, being married enhanced their mood. Previous studies also suggest that depressed people benefit from stable social support more than the non-depressed.   

Robin Simon, Ph.D., associate professor of sociology from Florida State University in Tallahassee, agrees that this is likely. ""The study's findings make perfect sense to me. One symptom of depression is loneliness and lack of companionship. I am not surprised that marriage would supply a psychological boost for the previously depressed,"" she said.

361,273231,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315346.php,Examining inflammation and gut bacteria in type 1 diabetes,Diabetes,Diabetes,GastroIntestinal / Gastroenterology,Immune System / Vaccines,,3,5,4,3,4,4,2,5,4,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,,,,"
Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease that affects an estimated 1-5 out of every 1,000 individuals in the U.S.

Type 1 diabetes usually appears during childhood and it cannot currently be cured. To date, the reason for its development in certain people is not known. 

In the 1970s, scientists discovered that the condition is caused by an autoimmune process. Then, in the 1980s, researchers found that suppressing the immune system slowed the disease's progress.

It is now known that the immune system mistakenly attacks beta cells in the pancreas, which are responsible for making insulin.

Researchers are investigating any angle that might offer fresh clues about the disease's etiology and how it might be tamed. Currently, the role of the gut in type 1 diabetes is a hot topic.

In recent years, a link between type 1 diabetes and the gut has risen to the surface. For instance, individuals with type 1 diabetes show increased intestinal permeability and changes in the microvilli, which are microscopic, finger-like projections from the gut lining.

Although the reasons behind these modifications are unclear, errant gut bacteria are currently the prime suspects.

The most recent study to investigate this interaction was published this week in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism. An Italian team set out to examine and measure changes in the gut's bacterial flora and levels of inflammation in people with type 1 diabetes.
""Some researchers have theorized that the gut may contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes, so it is important to understand how the disease affects the digestive system and microbiome.""Lorenzo Piemonti, senior author, San Raffaele Hospital
Data for the study came from 54 participants, all of whom had endoscopies and biopsies of their duodenum (the first section of the intestine). All samples were taken between 2009-2015 at the San Raffaele Hospital in Italy. The researchers ensured that the participants' diets were similar at the time of the procedure.

Earlier studies examining gut flora have relied on stool samples, but this method is flawed; it has previously been established that the bacterial composition of the duodenum and stool can differ significantly. The current approach, however, gave researchers a unique opportunity to directly assess the microbiome of these individuals and measure for biomarkers of inflammation. 

Additionally, because of the duodenum's close proximity to the pancreas, as well as their shared blood supply, directly sampling tissue from this region offered the opportunity to examine their relationship. 

In fact, a 2012 study using a mouse model found that if bacteria were artificially moved from the duodenum to the pancreatic ducts, an immune reaction was elicited that was potentially capable of destroying beta cells.

The results showed that those with type 1 diabetes had significantly more signs of inflammation than both the control participants and individuals with celiac disease. Specifically, 10 inflammation-related genes were expressed significantly more in those with type 1 diabetes. 

When the gut flora was examined, it was found to be markedly different from both the controls and those with celiac disease. In particular, they saw reduced levels of Proteobacteria (a wide group of organisms that includes Escherichia and Salmonella) and increased levels of Firmicutes (these include Bacilli and Streptococcus). This finding lines up well with studies in mouse models, in which similar changes in composition have been noted.

The next step will be to understand whether the changes in the gut are caused by type 1 diabetes or vice versa. Either way, the study marks a step forward in our understanding of this condition. As Piemonti notes:

""We don't know if type 1 diabetes' signature effect on the gut is caused by or the result of the body's own attacks on the pancreas. By exploring this, we may be able to find new ways to treat the disease by targeting the unique gastrointestinal characteristics of individuals with type 1 diabetes.""

The results indicate that there is a need for better understanding of the association between cancer and diabetes.

Previous studies have suggested that people with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of developing several different types of cancer.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) note that, in 2014, 29.1 million people, or 9.3 percent of the population of the United States, had diabetes, more than 3 times higher than in 1980.

Diabetes has been linked to heart disease, stroke, and damage to nerves and eye issues. There is also growing evidence of a link between type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer.

The American Cancer Society note that colon cancer, for example, is more likely to affect people with diabetes. Colon cancer shares many of the risk factors of diabetes, including body weight issues, a lack of physical activity, smoking, alcohol, and consuming a lot of red and processed meats. Colon cancer is also more likely to be fatal among people with type 2 diabetes.

Apart from shared risk factors, other suggestions to explain a link between various types of cancer and type 2 diabetes include the possibility of a biological link between the two, or that treatments for diabetes impact either the development or diagnosis of cancer.

A diagnosis of cancer often occurs immediately after a patient receives a diagnosis of diabetes. This may be because the discovery that they have diabetes means that they are more in contact with healthcare providers, and therefore more likely to undergo tests for other conditions.

Researchers from the University of Toronto, led by Dr. Iliana Lega, examined data for more than 1 million adults to assess the incidence of cancer at a variety of time points in their lives.

Findings showed that, compared with people without diabetes, patients with diabetes were 1.23 times more likely to have had a diagnosis of cancer in the 10 years before finding out they had diabetes.

People who received a diagnosis of diabetes were then more likely to receive a diagnosis of cancer, too, within the next 3 months. After this 3-month period, the likelihood of receiving a cancer diagnosis fell.

Dr. Lega suggests that this could be due to the extra screening that follows a diagnosis of diabetes.

She believes that as the prevalence of diabetes grows, this could imply an increase in the number of cancer cases.

She adds that the results support the idea that cancer and diabetes may have shared risk factors, and she suggests that lifestyle changes could help to reduce the incidence of both diseases.

""There is excellent evidence that diabetes can be prevented and that metabolic changes leading to diabetes can be reversed with lifestyle changes. Similarly, diet and exercise interventions have also been shown to reduce cancer risk and improve cancer outcomes in the general population.""Dr. Iliana Lega
The team believes that the findings are important because they emphasize the need for more research into the effect that exercise and a healthy diet can have on cancer risk, especially among patients who either have or are at risk of developing diabetes.

People with type 2 diabetes are at greater risk of serious liver disease than those without the condition, research has shown.

Researchers warn that hospital admissions and deaths caused by liver disease are likely to rise if cases of type 2 diabetes continue to increase at current rates.

The team examined cases of liver diseases among people with diabetes from anonymised, securely linked hospital records and death records in Scotland over a ten year period.

They found that most cases of liver disease in people with type 2 diabetes are not alcohol-related but caused by a build-up of fat within liver cells - a condition known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD.

NAFLD is commonly linked to obesity, which is also a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Most people can avoid getting these conditions by following a healthy diet and taking regular exercise.

The research team - led by the Universities of Edinburgh and Southampton - found that men with type 2 diabetes are three times more likely to suffer from NAFLD than men without diabetes.

There are fewer cases of type 2 diabetes and liver disease amongst women but having type 2 diabetes increases the risk of NAFLD by five times, the study found.

People with NAFLD are more susceptible to the effects of alcohol on the liver and should avoid drinking to avoid further complications, the researchers say.

Treatment options for NAFLD - which increases the risk of life-threatening complications such as cirrhosis and liver cancer - are limited.

The study involved researchers from the Scottish and Southampton Diabetes and Liver Disease Group. It is published in the Journal of Hepatology and was funded by the Scottish Government through the Scottish Diabetes Group.

Professor Sarah Wild, of the University of Edinburgh's Usher Institute for Population Health Sciences, said: ""Preventing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by avoiding unhealthy lifestyles in both people with and without diabetes is important because it is difficult to treat the complications of this condition.""

Professor Chris Byrne of the University of Southampton and University Hospital Southampton's, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre said: ""We have shown for the first time that type 2 diabetes is an important novel risk factor that increases numbers of hospital admissions and deaths, in people with all common chronic liver diseases. Further research is now needed to determine whether all patients with type 2 diabetes should be screened for common chronic liver diseases.""

The researchers transferred these microbes into other mice to see how they affected health. The results suggest that gut bacteria share some of the responsibility for the beneficial effects of fish oil and the harmful effects of lard.

In particular, mice that received transplants of gut microbes associated with a fish oil diet were protected against diet-induced weight gain and inflammation compared with mice transplanted with gut microbes associated with a lard diet. This demonstrates that gut microbes are an independent factor aggravating inflammation associated with diet-induced obesity and gives hope that a probiotic might help counteract a ""greasy"" diet.

""We wanted to determine whether gut microbes directly contribute to the metabolic differences associated with diets rich in healthy and unhealthy fats,"" says first study author Robert Caesar of the University of Gothenburg. Even though the study was done in mice, ""our goal is to identify interventions for optimizing metabolic health in humans.""

Caesar, working in the lab of senior study author Fredrik Bäckhed, began by feeding either lard or fish oil to mice for 11 weeks and monitoring signs of metabolic health. While the consumption of lard promoted the growth of bacteria called Bilophila, which have been linked to gut inflammation, the fish oil diet increased the abundance of bacteria called Akkermansia muciniphila, known to reduce weight gain and improve glucose metabolism in mice.

""We were surprised that the lard and the fish oil diet, despite having the same energy content and the same amount of dietary fiber--which is the primary energy source for the gut bacteria--resulted in fundamentally different gut microbiota communities and that the microbiota per se had such large effects on health,"" Caesar says.

In the next set of experiments, Caesar conducted ""fecal transplants"" to test whether fish oil-diet microbes could improve the health of mice fed only lard and vice versa. The results provide additional evidence that gut microbe communities can both determine and recover health problems caused by poor diet.

""Our paper supports previous reports indicating the bacteria Akkermansia muciniphila is a promoter of a healthy phenotype,"" Bäckhed says. ""However, further investigations will be needed to determine if this bacteria can be used as probiotic strain and, in that case, how it should be combined with diet to optimize health outcomes.""

The East London Family (ELF) Study found that a mother's perception of effective general family functioning has a significant effect on limiting the intake of sugary foods and drinks by their three and four year old children. In contrast, less effective family functioning leads to high frequency intake of sugary foods and drinks by three and four year old children in the family.

'Effective family functioning' was defined as a family which is able to manage daily life and resolve problems in the context of warm and effective family interactions, through clear communication, well-defined roles and flexible behaviour control.

Professor Wagner Marcenes, who led the study at Queen Mary University of London, explains: ""Our research adopted a broad definition of 'family' and we included single parents, and those who are divorced, co-habiting, and same sex family types.""

The report shows that children from more functional families were 67 per cent less likely to consume more than four intakes of sugary foods and drinks a day, compared with children from less functional families.

""Effective family functioning is a safeguard against the well-known negative impact of lower levels of education in relation to sugar consumption"" Professor Marcenes continued. ""A significant number of children whose mothers had a lower level of qualification but whose family functioning was effective were more likely to consume less than four intakes of sugary foods compared with their counterparts whose family functioning was impaired. ""

The research involved 1,174 children aged three and four years, and their parents, and aimed to investigate the importance of family functioning for health.

The ELF study is a major two generation family study involving more than 50 researchers. It is believed to be the first study which demonstrates that high sugar consumption is related to poor family functioning.

The report demonstrated that effective family functioning led to a healthy diet even among those with lower education, living in a deprived area and experiencing financial challenges.

Professor Marcenes explains: ""We live in a very materialistic world but material resources alone cannot fulfil us. We also need to meet our psychological needs. A functional family is a major source of pleasure in life, providing comfort and reward. In contrast, dysfunctional families are a major source of frustration and stress - and this can lead to high sugar consumption in the search for the 'feel-good' effect.""

Dr Sucharita Nanjappa, University of Dundee, who co-authored this report and was involved in many different aspects of the ELF study says: ""This study gathered information on the whole family's day to day experiences. This has the potential to lead to interventions that are based on identifying, encouraging and developing the family's own positive resources to help improve the health of its members - through the acquisition of healthy lifestyle.""

These findings have major implications for population health. Eating too much sugar is linked to a long list of negative health effects, including diabetes, heart disease, obesity and tooth decay.

Recently, a committee of scientists has advised the World Health Organization (WHO) and governments that no more than 5 per cent of daily calories should come from added sugar (about seven teaspoons). This is far less than the current average intake of sugar worldwide.

Professor Wagner Marcenes concludes: ""Public health needs to move beyond the naïve belief that health education based on risk awareness raising programmes alone will lead to behavioural change across the population. If this were the case, doctors and nurses would not smoke, drink above the limit and eat sweets.

""It is crucial to understand why we crave for sugar and to identify factors that help people to deal with sugar craving. We need to focus on the wider determinants of health behaviour and lifestyle, such as socio-psychological factors.""

The next step in this research programme is to develop a simple and cost-effective intervention to improve family functioning.

It is widely known that the use of  aspirin  and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or  NSAIDS , may reduce the risk of  colorectal cancer  by up to 40 percent, but this protective effect may not extend to long-term smokers, who already face an increased risk of the disease, according to a study led by researchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
   
In a large, population-based study comparing risk factors in people with and without colorectal cancer, the researchers found the highest risk of  colon cancer  to be among long-term smokers of 20 or more years who had never used NSAIDs. The researchers also found that smokers who used NSAIDs were still at an approximate 30 percent higher risk of colon cancer than nonsmokers.
   
The findings, which appeared in the July 1 issue of Cancer Research, arise from the first study of its kind to examine the effects of NSAID use on colorectal-cancer risk among smokers, said first author Victoria Chia, a research associate in the Hutchinson Center's Cancer Prevention Program.
   
""Smoking has been linked to a modestly increased risk of colorectal cancer, and use of NSAIDs has been shown to significantly decrease the risk of colorectal cancer. We wanted to see if NSAIDs could counteract the adverse effects of smoking with regard to colorectal-cancer risk, and whether these associations differed by  tumor  characteristics,"" she said.
   
In particular, Chia and colleagues were interested in examining the impact of NSAIDs on a certain type of colorectal tumor that may be associated with smoking. Such tumors display microsatellite instability, an acquired genetic characteristic that indicates defects in DNA-repair machinery. Microsatellite instability, or MSI, occurs in approximately 15 percent to 20 percent of colon cancers.
   
The researchers found a two-fold increased risk of microsatellite-unstable colorectal tumors among long-term smokers who took NSAIDs -- about the same risk as smokers who had not used NSAIDs.
   
""Given the damage that smokers receive over their lifetime, even strong anti-progression agents, like NSAIDs, may be ineffective,"" the authors wrote. ""NSAIDs may not be able to counteract the long-term effects of smoking, as evidenced by our observation that long-term smokers are at increased risk of colorectal cancer, despite current NSAID use.""
   
The link between smoking and  cancer  stems from the fact that cigarette smoke contains hundreds of carcinogenic metabolic products that may damage DNA. ""This accumulated damage might not be reversible,"" Chia said. ""NSAIDs act to suppress inflammatory processes and may help limit the progression toward cancer. However, people who have microsatellite-unstable tumors may be even more susceptible to the effects of smoking because they already have a reduced capacity to repair DNA, even in the presence of strong anti-inflammatory agents.""
   
Funded by the National Cancer Institute and the National Institutes of Health, the study involved 3,299 Seattle-area residents between the ages of 20 and 74 (mean age 60), approximately half with a history of colon cancer and approximately half without, who served as a control, or comparison group. Cancer cases were identified through the Puget Sound Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program, a population-based registry. Controls were randomly selected to match the distribution of the cases regarding age and sex. Participants were interviewed by telephone about their smoking history and use of aspirin and other NSAID use, among other risk factors. Microsatellite instability was assessed in tumors from 1,202 cases.
   
Smoking was more common in cancer cases than controls, and NSAID use was more common among controls than cases.
   
Researchers from the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine collaborated on the study.

Asthma is a chronic disease of the lungs' airways that affects approximately 334 million people worldwide, and around 25 million people in the United States.

Historically, it was believed that asthma is a disease of high-income countries, but this theory is no longer valid as most people living with asthma are from low- and middle-income countries. 

Across the world, asthma prevalence is distributed unevenly. The highest prevalence worldwide occurs in Latin America and in English-speaking countries (where over 20 percent of the population live with asthma), whereas the lowest prevalence (at less than 5 percent) was noted in India, Asia-Pacific, and the Eastern part of the Mediterranean, as well as Northern and Eastern Europe.

Countries such as Canada and Ecuador both have a significant incidence of the disease, with approximately 10 percent of the population living with asthma. 

New research suggests that a yeast in the gut of Ecuador-born babies may be a strong predictor for childhood asthma. The study was carried out by a team of researchers from the University of British Columbia in Canada and was led by microbiologist Brett Finlay. 

The findings were presented at the annual meeting for Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston, MA.

In the past, Finlay and his colleagues examined the gut microbiota of Canadian children and its connections to asthma. They found four gut bacteria that appeared to prevent the onset of asthma if they were present in the infants' guts within the first 3 months of life. 

Now, in this follow-up study, Finlay and team replicated the experiment in an Ecuadorian village, in an attempt to investigate whether the beneficial role of the gut's microbiome is universal. 

Using stool samples and health information from more than 100 children, scientists found that the gut's bacteria do play a key role in preventing asthma. However, among the early-life microbes, a yeast known as Pichia seems to increase the risk of asthma if present in the babies' early days of life. 

The research further emphasizes the key role of the gut's microbiota in maintaining the body's general health and protecting against serious illness. 

Bacteria living in our gut have been shown to strengthen the body's immune system, acting as a barrier against new, harmful microorganisms. The gut's microbiome - which contains more than 1,000 forms of known bacteria - also aids digestion and produces some important vitamins.  

The study, led by Finlay, also looked at the cleanliness of the Ecuadorian water and environment and found some surprising conclusions.

""Those that had access to good, clean water had much higher asthma rates and we think it is because they were deprived of the beneficial microbes. That was a surprise because we tend to think that clean is good but we realize that we actually need some dirt in the world to help protect you.""  Brett Finlay
To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first of its kind. ""This is the first time anyone has shown any kind of association between yeast and asthma,"" Finlay notes.

Next, the researchers plan to re-examine the Canadian samples from their previous study and look for the recently discovered fungus in the babies' guts.   
Learn why a third of asthma patients may be misdiagnosed.

Girls who were overweight as children are likely to begin using cigarettes, marijuana or alcohol at an earlier age than their healthy-weight peers, according to a new study by researchers in the Indiana University School of Education.

But the correlation between weight and substance use shows up only when the data are broken down by the subjects' racial or ethnic group and sex. Previous research that didn't take those categories into account found only a weak relationship between childhood weight and substance use.

""Childhood weight status and timing of first substance use in an ethnically diverse sample,"" published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence, is the first study to examine the relationship between childhood weight and the timing of first substance use while taking into account the sex and race or ethnicity of the subjects. Authors are Jennifer C. Duckworth and Kelly A. Doran, doctoral students in the Department of Counseling and Educational Psychology, and Mary Waldron, associate professor in the department.

""Early drinking and drug use are associated with increased risk of problem substance use,"" Duckworth said. ""Identifying predictors of early substance use, including weight status during childhood, can help us develop targeted substance abuse prevention.""

Using data for nearly 7,000 subjects from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, the researchers examined the relationship between the weight status of children at age 7 or 8 and the age at which they began using substances.

They found that being overweight as a child was associated with earlier alcohol and marijuana use among Hispanic females and with earlier cigarette and marijuana use among white females. Among black females, however, there was little or no correlation between childhood weight and age of first use of cigarettes, marijuana or alcohol.

By contrast, obese white males and underweight Hispanic and black males were less likely than their peers to start using illegal substances as adolescents.

""What was most surprising, at least to us, were the different patterns observed for girls and boys,"" Waldron said. ""Again, for girls, earlier substance use was associated with being overweight as a child, especially for Hispanic girls. For boys, unhealthy weight status predicted later substance use.""

Previous research on the relationship between weight and adolescent substance use typically pooled together data for boys and girls and for black, white and Hispanic youth, resulting in few or no obvious trends. But it only makes sense to break out the data by racial and ethnic groups and by sex, the IU researchers say, because there are well-documented differences in obesity rates and in rates of substance use among different groups of children and youth.

But additional research will be required to understand the reasons for the differences. The researchers say socio-developmental mechanisms may be a factor: For example, early puberty is associated both with childhood weight and early substance use, but more so for girls.

Also, being obese, overweight or underweight can have consequences for forming peer relationships. And the types of relationships that young people form may influence their opportunities and motivation to experiment with substance use.

The authors say the study can provide guidance for agencies and individuals that work with youth. The findings suggest that Hispanic girls, in particular, could benefit from early screening and education programs aimed at delaying substance use and ultimately reducing the risk of problem use of cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana.

A new study shows older men with early stage  prostate cancer  survive longer if they are treated versus not being treated in favor of the ""watchful waiting"" approach advocated by many physicians for older men with other health problems. In addition, the study revealed a survival benefit for men treated with  radiation therapy  making it the first study to demonstrate a survival advantage in an older population. The study was presented by Fox Chase Cancer Center medical oncologist Yu-Ning Wong, M.D., at the 2006 Prostate Cancer Symposium Feb. 25 in San Francisco.    

The study examines survival data of more than 48,606 men between 65 and 80 years old who survived at least one year after a diagnosis of localized prostate cancer ( cancer  that has not spread beyond the prostate).    

Since the advent of the PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test about 20 years ago, many more cases of prostate cancer have been diagnosed at earlier stages.    

""Some prostate cancers grow so slowly that they never become life-threatening, especially in elderly men who may die of other causes before the cancer causes problems,"" explained Wong. ""But other men develop complications and die from their cancer making the decision to treat quite difficult.""    

It remains unclear whether detecting early prostate tumors translates into an equivalent benefit of saving lives and whether the benefits of early detection outweigh the risks of complications from follow up diagnostic tests and cancer treatments.    

The cases examined in this study were diagnosed between 1991 and 1999. The men ranged from 65 to 80 years old at diagnosis. Median age at diagnosis was 72. A total of 34,046 men received treatment with either radiation therapy (19,948) or surgery--radical prostatectomy--to remove the prostate (14,098). The remaining 14,560 men were only observed (watchful waiting).    

More than half the treated men were alive by the end of the study, with a median survival of 13 years. Median survival for the group receiving observation was about 10 years.    

""This large, population-based study demonstrates a survival advantage for men treated with either radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy compared to observation,"" Wong said. ""Eligible men should be considered for both treatment options.""

A study by Florida State University professor Robin Simon and Vanderbilt University\'s Ranae Evenson found that parents have significantly higher levels of  depression  than adults who do not have children. Even more surprising, the symptoms of depression do not go away when the kids grow up and move out of the house.    

Empty nest parents, as Simon and Evenson call them, are no less depressed than non-parents. The researchers, who analyzed data from the National Survey of Families and Households, theorize that parents are still involved in their adult children\'s lives and continue to be concerned about them. That has an emotional cost.    

\""Parents have more to worry about than other people do - that\'s the bottom line,\"" Simon said. \""And that worry does not diminish over time. Parents worry about their kids\' emotional, social, physical and economic well-being. We worry about how they\'re getting along in the world.\""    

One of the most interesting findings of the study, which was published in the American Sociological Association\'s Journal of Health and Social Behavior, is that there is no type of parent that reports less depression than non-parents, Simon said. That is significant because other major adult roles in the United States, such as being married and employed, are associated with enhanced emotional well-being.    

They also found that certain types of parents have higher levels of depression than other parents. Parents of adult children, whether they live at home or not, and parents who do not have custody of their minor children have more symptoms of depression.    

This means that parents living with their minor children, whether they are biological, adopted or stepchildren, have the least symptoms of depression - a finding that contradicts the assumption that these parents have the most distress.    

\""Young children in some ways are emotionally easier,\"" Simon said. \""Little kids, little problems. Big kids, big problems.\""    

Parents who are married also have fewer symptoms of depression than those who are unmarried, a finding that surprised neither researcher. But they were surprised - shocked, actually - to find that the effects of parenthood on depression were the same for men and women. These findings are inconsistent with some earlier studies and with the assumption that parenthood is more consequential for the emotional well-being of women, Simon said.    

The findings do not mean that parents don\'t find any pleasure in their roles; it\'s just that the emotional costs can outweigh the psychological benefits. That\'s because,as the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child, but in the United States, parents don\'t necessarily have community support or help from extended family.    

\""It\'s how we do parenting in this society,\"" Simon said. \""We do it in a very isolated way and the onus is on us as individuals to get it right. Our successes are our own, but so are our failures. It\'s emotionally draining.\""    

The value of a study like this is that it presents a realistic view of the difficulties associated with parenthood and encourages parents to seek greater social support, Simon said.    

\""Parents should know they are not alone; other people are feeling this way, too,\"" she said. \""This is a really difficult role, but we romanticize it in American culture. Parenthood is not the way it is in TV commercials.\""

When we eat, we do not just take in nutrients - we also consume a significant quantity of bacteria. The body is faced with the challenge of simultaneously distributing the ingested glucose and fighting these bacteria. This triggers an inflammatory response that activates the immune systems of healthy individuals and has a protective effect, as doctors from the University and the University Hospital Basel have proven for the first time. In overweight individuals, however, this inflammatory response fails so dramatically that it can lead to diabetes.

It is well known that type 2 diabetes (or adult-onset diabetes) leads to chronic inflammation with a range of negative impacts. A number of clinical studies have therefore treated diabetes by impeding the over-production of a substance involved in this process, Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). In diabetes patients, this messenger substance triggers chronic inflammation and causes insulin-producing beta cells to die off.

This inflammation does have some positive aspects, however, as was recently reported in the journal Nature Immunology by researchers from the Department of Biomedicine at the University and the University Hospital Basel. In healthy individuals, short-term inflammatory responses play an important role in sugar uptake and the activation of the immune system.

In their work, Professor Marc Donath, Head of the Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at the University Hospital Basel and his research team demonstrate that the number of macrophages (a type of immune cell) around the intestines increases during meal times. These so-called ""scavenger cells­"" produce the messenger substance IL-1beta in varying amounts, depending on the concentration of glucose in the blood. This, in turn, stimulates insulin production in pancreatic beta cells. The insulin then causes the macrophages to increase IL-1beta production. Insulin and IL-1beta work together to regulate blood sugar levels, while the messenger substance IL-1beta ensures that the immune system is supplied with glucose and thus remains active.

According to the researchers, this mechanism of the metabolism and immune system is dependent on the bacteria and nutrients that are ingested during meals. With sufficient nutrients, the immune system is able to adequately combat foreign bacteria. Conversely, when there is a lack of nutrients, the few remaining calories must be conserved for important life functions at the expense of an immune response. This may go some way towards explaining why infectious diseases occur more frequently in times of famine.

Obesity is a problem worldwide but particularly in the United States. Over one third of adults in the U.S. are obese, and the 2008 annual medical costs for people who were obese were $1,429 higher than for those who were of a normal weight.

Additionally, obesity increases risks for heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer - which are some of the leading causes of preventable death.

According to the researchers of the latest study, chronic dieters are known to show extreme reactions to food cues in both the executive control and reward areas of the brain.

To further investigate, the team carried out their research on a group of 36 chronic female dieters who had a mean body fat percentage of 29.6 and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 23.9.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), BMI can be an indicator of body fatness. If BMI is less than 18.5, a person is considered underweight. BMI between 18.5-25 is considered normal, whereas 25-30 is overweight and 30 or higher is considered obese.

The researchers asked the study participants to make simple judgments on images to avert their attention from the real task at hand, which was a food cue reactivity task. This was designed to pinpoint the executive control and reward areas in the brain through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Once the researchers had identified the executive and control reward areas, they used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to establish the integrity of the white matter track that connects these areas.

Based on the fMRI results, the team found that the participants showed greater reactivity to food images than control images.

Furthermore, the DTI results showed that participants with lower body fat percentages had greater white matter integrity between the executive control and reward areas of the brain.

The researchers note that it is unclear whether these differences in white matter integrity resulted from repeat dieting. 

However, they add that although ""a previous study found that repeatedly practicing a task can lead to increased [measures of white matter integrity] in particular fiber tracts, it is also possible that failures in dieting lead to obesity and obesity-related factors.""

The team says the findings support their hypothesis that structural integrity in the brain coincides with individual body fat differences. They say it is also indicative of dieting success and add:
 ""Individuals with reduced integrity may have difficulty in overriding rewarding temptations, leading to a greater chance of becoming obese than those with higher structural integrity.""

It is important to note that the study only included female dieters, so whether the results also apply to men is still unknown. The researchers say further study is needed to determine whether these same effects apply to male dieters.

""Essentially those with a college degree or more education are benefitting more from the positive health behavior of physical activity than other groups,"" said Kyle Chapman, a KU doctoral candidate in sociology. ""That's going to create more inequality in the future.""

The key finding of the study is after controlling for diet, body-mass index and social factors, adults with a college degree who are physically active were 6 percent less likely to have pre-diabetic symptoms or elevated levels of blood glucose than college-educated adults in the U.S. who are considered physically inactive. For adults with some college, a high school diploma or who never graduated high school, at best physical activity only accounted for a 1 percent less chance they would have pre-diabetic symptoms.

""What we see here are these big differences in those at risk for diabetes,"" Chapman said.

Generally being active reduced the likelihood that individuals would have full-blown diabetes as well. However, the probability of having diabetes was lowest among people with a college degree at 2.5 percent for those physically active and 4.4 percent for those inactive. By contrast, a person would no high school diploma had a 5 percent probability of having diabetes if they are physically active and 7.2 percent if inactive.

The study analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2012 that combined interviews, physical exams and laboratory tests. Chapman will present his study, ""Diabetes Disparities by Education and Activity Level,"" at 8:30 a.m., Monday, Aug. 24, at the 110th Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association (ASA).

""It does raise questions on whether or not we want to suggest to practitioners and to public health officials for initiatives on things we can do to alleviate some of the problems, especially in the lives of those with less than a high school education,"" Chapman said.

He said the findings seem to support past research that has shown that people of higher levels of education tend to have access to environments that are more conducive to exercise and healthier lifestyles, such as gym memberships or living in nicer neighborhoods that encourage walking.

Also, he said college graduates likely could work in jobs that give them more financial stability and flexibility that will allow them to live with fewer social stressors.

The study doesn't recommend steps to correct the disparities, but it should serve as a starting point for discussions on how to address preventing and managing diabetes, especially among individuals for which the current practices are less effective, Chapman said.

""This is real, and if we continue down this road, we're going to be helping the college educated more than we're helping the less educated,"" he said. ""The less educated are the people who actually need it more.""

In older children, it can also include staying out all night and use of weapons.The researchers note that evidence already exists that the brains of people with serious behavior problems are different, but this tends to be simplistic and focused in limited regions, such as the amygdala - the brain's emotion center.However, conduct disorder is a complex behavioral disorder, and one might expect the brain differences to be more complex and affect more than one brain region, they suggest.Therefore, in their investigation, the team looked for brain regions with similar or different thicknesses as this might indicate coordinated or non-coordinated development between regions.For the study, the researchers carried out MRI brain scans on 58 male teenagers and young adults diagnosed with conduct disorder. They also included 25 peers without such a diagnosis, as typically developing, ""healthy"" controls. The participants were all aged 16-21.The researchers found that participants with childhood onset conduct disorder - sometimes referred to as ""early starters"" - had a strikingly higher number of cases where brain regions had the same thickness as controls.In contrast, the participants with adolescent-onset conduct disorder - sometimes termed ""late starters"" - had a lower number of cases where brain regions had the same thickness compared with controls.The researchers confirmed the findings with a separate, independent sample of 37 participants with conduct disorder and 32 healthy controls. All participants in this second sample were male, aged 13-18.Prof. Fairchild says the differences between the youths with both forms of conduct disorder and their healthy peers ""show that most of the brain is involved, but particularly the frontal and temporal regions of the brain.""He argues that the findings are ""compelling evidence"" that conduct disorder is a ""real psychiatric disorder,"" and not just an exaggerated form of teenage rebellion as some experts have suggested.The study also indicates there are important differences in the brains of people who develop conduct disorder early in childhood and those who develop it later during their teens.However, while the findings highlight the key role the brain plays in the development of conduct disorder, they do not explain how the changes come about. For example, to what extent are they influenced by people's genes, and to what extent are they affected by the environment they are raised in?While the study does not answer these questions, the researchers believe the findings could help to measure the effect of interventions. Using a brain map of conduct disorder it might be possible, for example, to see if interventions such as psychological therapy can reverse some of the changes noted in the study.""More research is now needed to investigate how to use these results to help these young people clinically and to examine the factors leading to this abnormal pattern of brain development, such as exposure to early adversity.""Prof. Graeme FairchildDiscover how marijuana and alcohol use can harm teens' mental health and school work.",1

In Appalachia,  diabetes  hits hard.  Depression  does, too. Together, they form a difficult pair to beat.    


To help patients fight back, a team of Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine (OU-COM) and Ohio University researchers have put together a new approach to the double-edged problem. Program ACTIVE (Appalachians Coming Together to Increase Vital Exercise) is a two-year intervention feasibility study to test the effectiveness of a combination of exercise and talk therapy as a treatment for depression in patients with  type 2 diabetes .   

""Diabetes is a difficult disease,"" said Mary de Groot, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychology and lead author of a paper produced by the research team. ""Add depression on top of that, and it makes it that much tougher.""   

Their paper, ""Depression among type 2 Diabetes Rural Appalachian Clinic Attendees,"" is published in the June issue of Diabetes Care, the journal of the American Diabetes Association.   

The researchers point out that previously published studies have shown that depressive symptoms in diabetics are ""associated with worsened blood glucose levels, diabetes complications, increased functional disability, worsened adherence to diabetes regimen, higher ambulatory care costs, and increased mortality.""   

The study looked at type 2 diabetes patients attending family medicine and  endocrinology  appointments in rural Appalachian counties of Southeastern Ohio and West Virginia. Of those 201 patients, 31 percent reported co-morbid diabetes and depression through completion of the Beck Depression Inventory, a self-report questionnaire assessment.   

That rate is similar to the national co-morbidity rate, somewhat surprisingly low considering the relatively high rate of poverty where the patients live. For instance, Meigs County, Ohio, has a poverty rate of 19.8 percent, compared to 10.6 percent for the state of Ohio.   

""My vision of it is that people in Appalachia have sort of a higher tolerance for bad things,"" said Frank Schwartz, M.D., assistant professor of endocrinology at OU-COM and director of the Appalachian Rural Health Institute (ARHI) Diabetes Center.   

""What is compelling is the length of episodes of depression,"" said de Groot, the principal investigator. A follow-up study of the patients involved showed that 88 percent of those who had initially identified themselves as suffering from depression also did so 18 months later. Depression severity was associated with younger age, unemployment and a greater number of prescribed medications. These findings are consistent with those observed in urban samples. 

""Part of the significance of the paper is that it helps put rural Appalachia on the map in terms of depression and diabetes,"" de Groot said.   

According to Schwartz, in research conducted by the ARHI Diabetes Center, Appalachia has a diabetes prevalence rate of 11.3 percent well above the 7.6 percent national rate.   

De Groot and her colleagues encourage doctors to screen their diabetic patients for depression. People with diabetes are twice as likely to have an experience with depression as those without diabetes.   

For patients, de Groot said, it is vital to share feelings and mood symptoms with their doctors. It's important, too, to know that talk therapy has been shown to be effective in treating depression in type 2 diabetes, she said, and that  antidepressant  medications have been effective in treating depression in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.   

Program ACTIVE is the researchers' way of doing something about the situation.   
 To meet the depression criterion for Program ACTIVE, patients must have felt consistently depressed or down for most of the day nearly every day for two weeks or longer. Associated symptoms people experience are:    

-- a significant decrease in interest in activities they would ordinarily enjoy;   
-- changes in sleep;   
-- changes in appetite;   
-- weight loss or gain;   
-- difficulty with concentration;   
-- feelings of worthlessness;   
-- and significantly decreased energy.   

Program ACTIVE, which is funded by the National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), combines 12 weeks of exercise with 10 sessions of talk therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes and depression for two weeks or longer. The aim is to assess improvements made during the program in depression, diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors.   

Participants have free access to the workout facilities at the Athens Community Center, which is one of the program's community partners, as are University Medical Associates, Family Health Care Inc. and Holzer Clinic in Athens. Talk therapy, or  cognitive behavioral therapy , sessions are conducted in Athens.   


""If we can show effective intervention, this will become a program that is implemented in many high-risk environments,"" Schwartz said.   

Schwartz and his colleague at the Cornwell Center for Cardiovascular and Diabetes Care in Athens, Jay Shubrook, D.O., assistant professor of family medicine at OU-COM, are co-investigators in Program ACTIVE, as is Michael Kushnick, Ph.D., exercise physiologist with Ohio University's Department of Recreation and Sports Sciences. 

The team received funding for its initial study from the Ohio University Diabetes Research Initiative (DRI), and the NIDDK. Ohio University's DRI funded the 18-month follow-up study.   

In addition to de Groot, Schwartz and Shubrook, co-authors of the paper are Robert Gotfried, D.O.; Brenda Pinkerman, Ph.D., who earned a doctorate in clinical psychology from Ohio University; and graduate students Todd Doyle, Erin Hockman and Charles Wheeler.   

The mission of Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine is innovative learning, focused research and compassionate care for Ohio and beyond. Each year more than 100 osteopathic physicians graduate from OU-COM, Ohio's only college of osteopathic medicine. Fifty-four percent of OU-COM alumni practice in primary care fields, and more than 60 percent of its graduates remain in Ohio, where they are more likely to practice in rural and other physician-shortage areas.

A gas that was formerly known for its noxious qualities could help people with diabetes recover from common heart and blood vessel complications, concludes research led by the University of Exeter Medical School.

The research could help pave the way to new treatments for some of the most common complications association with diabetes. Heart problems are a common cause of disability and death in people with diabetes, and are expected to rise still further with increasing rates of obesity. Currently, 79% of the £14 billion spent on treating diabetes in the NHS is spent on treating complications.

Laboratory research published in Pharmacological Research and funded by the European Union and Medical Research Council has yielded promising results from new drugs which selectively target minute quantities of the foul smelling gas hydrogen sulfide inside blood vessel cells. Research indicates the drugs AP39 and AP123 could help prevent sugar (glucose) from damaging endothelial cells, which line blood vessels and form an interface that regulates the exchanges of materials such as oxygen and food metabolites between blood and surrounding tissue.

People with diabetes have an excess of glucose in their blood (hyperglycaemia). This leads to the mitochondria, the ""power house"" of the cell which normally regulates energy production and use inside cells very tightly, becoming inefficient and leaky. They then produce highly toxic metabolites of oxygen (free radicals). The resulting toxicity to the mitochondria in the endothelial cells damages blood vessels in the circulation and the heart. This can deprive organs of the blood they need to function, potentially resulting in kidney disease or retinopathy, whicn cause blindness. Around 1,280 cases of blindness causes by diabetes each year in England alone, with a further 4,200 people identified as at risk of vision loss from this cause. Damaged blood vessels can also contribute to kidney disease, which can affect up to one in three people with diabetes.

Now, research using endothelial cells isolated from the small blood vessels in the brains of mice has revealed that carefully targeting minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide to the mitochondria inside cells using AP39 or AP123 restored the efficiency of the mitochondria and prevented hyperglycaemia-induced build up of free radicals. The team found that the effects of the drugs were long-lasting, suggesting that they could help to treat heart problems and blood vessel complications that occur in the heart, kidney and eyes of people with diabetes.

Professor Matthew Whiteman, of the University of Exeter Medical School, who led the study, said: ""We're producing a growing body of evidence that hydrogen sulfide can have a range of health benefits, when carefully administered in minute doses in a highly targeted way in the body. Mitochondria can even make their own hydrogen sulfide and use it as a 'fuel' to keep metabolism efficient. When this 'fuel' is lost, mitochondria, cells, blood vessels and tissues are damaged. We previously showed that replacing the lost hydrogen sulfide with AP39 reversed this damage in cardiac arrest, hypertension and kidney failure damage and this current study adds AP123 to our portfolio of promising new drugs for diabetes.

""Some people find it amusing that a substance with such a bad reputation can produce these benefits, but nearly every cell in our body makes and responds to tiny amounts of hydrogen sulfide and we have at least three distinct pathways for making this gas in very small quantities so it is very important. We must now continue working hard towards taking our findings forward in humans"".

For each additional month of paid maternity leave offered in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), infant mortality is reduced by 13%, according to a new study by researchers from McGill University and UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.

The finding, published in the journal PLOS Medicine, marks the first time that research has examined the impact of paid maternity leave on infant mortality in LMICs. Previous work has shown that paid time off is consistently associated with lower mortality of babies under one year old in high-income countries.

""A significant number of countries where the vast majority of maternal and child deaths occur provide less than 12 weeks of paid leave to new mothers,"" said lead author Arijit Nandi, an Assistant Professor at McGill's Institute for Health and Social Policy and the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health. ""Our findings suggest that paid maternity leave policies are a potential instrument for reducing preventable child deaths, even in countries where women are less likely to be working in the formal economy.""

To carry out their analysis, researchers utilized statistics on approximately 300,000 children born over a period of eight years in 20 LMICs - across Africa, Asia and Latin America, and combined that data with information on government maternity leave policies in those countries. They teased out the effects of lengthening paid maternity leave by comparing infant mortality rates in countries that expanded benefits with rates in countries where policies remained the same.

After controlling for variables such as gross domestic product and per capita spending on health, the researchers found that adding just one month to the length of paid leave prevents about 8 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, equivalent to a 13% reduction in mortality. The most significant life-saving effect of extending paid maternity leave occurs during the post-neonatal period, when babies range in age from about one month to one year.

The study's authors theorize that paid and extended maternity leave may help to reduce infant mortality in several ways, including the following:

   
One hundred and eighty-eight countries guarantee paid leave of some sort for new mothers. ""While this study focuses on low- and middle-income countries, the impact in high-income countries is also well demonstrated. For the health of our children and the well-being of families, the U.S. needs to catch up with most of the world and ensure all new parents have paid parental leave,"" said study author Dr. Jody Heymann, formerly of McGill and now dean of the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and founding director of the WORLD Policy Analysis Center.

In Canada as well as in many European countries, a new mother is entitled to up to one year of paid time off. Only a few countries have no paid maternity leave mandate. They include Papua New Guinea, Suriname, and the United States.

In future work, Nandi said, ""We plan to document the effects of paid maternity leave on women's outcomes, including their labor force participation, health, and well-being, as well as the implications of paternal leave policies.""

A new study from a group of international researchers has identified a potentially effective tool to reduce the long-term health risks of childhood obesity-aerobic exercise.

In a study published in the early online edition of the International Journal of Obesity, researchers at the University of Georgia, the Menzies Institute for Medical Research in Hobart, Australia, and the George Institute for Global Health at Oxford University found that higher aerobic fitness in childhood, independent of abdominal fat, reduced the risk of developing metabolic syndrome in early adulthood by 36 percent compared to those with lower childhood fitness levels.

Metabolic syndrome is a clustering of key cardiovascular disease risk factors and is associated with an increased risk of subsequent coronary artery disease, stroke and Type 2 diabetes.

The study used data collected as part of a 20-year follow-up of 1,792 Australians who participated in a national childhood health and fitness survey at age 7 to 15 years in 1985. Data collection included a 1-mile run to assess cardiorespiratory fitness and waist circumference measures to assess abdominal fat in childhood. As adults, participants attended one of 34 study clinics held across Australia where they underwent a range of additional health and fitness assessments.

""While a number of studies have found that higher levels of aerobic fitness can substantially reduce the cardiovascular disease risks associated with adult obesity, few studies have looked to see whether this might also be true regarding childhood obesity,"" said the study's lead author Michael Schmidt, an associate professor in the College of Education's department of kinesiology.

While the long-term cardiovascular risks of childhood obesity were reduced among those with higher childhood fitness, children with higher levels of abdominal fat still had a three-fold increased risk of adult metabolic syndrome after adjusting for their fitness level.

However, the combination of both a high waist circumference and low cardiorespiratory fitness in childhood proved especially potent as these participants were over eight times more likely to have the metabolic syndrome in adulthood than those who had low waist circumference and high aerobic fitness levels.

The study's results also support the importance of staying physically active beyond childhood.

""We found that participants who had low fitness levels in childhood but increased their relative fitness level by adulthood had a markedly lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome than those who remained low fit,"" said study co-author Erika Rees, a doctoral student in kinesiology. ""And this was especially true for those with higher levels of abdominal fat as children.""

Schmidt said that the findings come with an important caveat. ""Our findings are based on the waist circumference and fitness levels among Australian children in 1985. Children in the U.S. and other developed countries today have substantially higher levels of abdominal fat and much lower levels of aerobic fitness. Therefore, fewer of today's children may have the level of fitness needed to partially offset the negative cardiovascular disease risks of childhood obesity.""

New research findings suggest that a child's behaviour during the age of 10-11 could predict whether he/she will suffer from  depression , have violent tendencies or have social  phobia  later in life.    
The study looked at the data on 765 children 10-11 years of age.  They followed the kids up for a period of ten years.  Those who at the age of 10-11 were involved in fighting, stealing or had other behaviour problems had four times the normal risk of developing depression or violent behaviour as a 21-year-old adult.    
Dr. W. Alex Mason , led researcher, said to the Reuters news agency ""The good news is that the findings in this study suggest that parents, teachers, and service providers might be able to identify children with conduct problems at an early age and intervene to reduce those problems as a way to prevent later violence and depression.""    
Other studies have suggested an association between childhood  anxiety  and depression and adult depression and anxiety disorders.  Most studies seem to agree that behavioural problems (and emotional) during childhood increases the chances of children becoming antisocial adults.    
The problem with previous studies is that one could not make conclusions regarding society at large as the children being monitored were all from clinics rather than from the general community.    
This latest study has overcome this limitation.  Dr. Mason and his team (Washington University) studied Seattle schoolchildren aged 10-11 in high crime neighbourhoods.    
A decade later they found that 21% of the children they had been monitoring had committed at least two violent acts during the previous twelve months.  20% had experienced depression while 17% had experienced some kind or social phobia over the previous twelve months.    
The researchers found there was link between the children's own records earlier in life and violent behaviour, depression or social phobia as early adults.    
You can read about this study in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.    
There was also a link, although less significant, between shyness during childhood and increased risk of social phobia later in life.    
The scientists found a stronger link between violent behaviour and adult depression from the parental and teacher reports than from the children's reports on themselves.    
Mason also stressed that it is normal for children to be involved in some kind of conduct problems during their lives.  He said that it was when those problems started earlier than was thought typical that it may be a sign of increased risk of things to come.    
When asked why there might be this association between childhood conduct problems and adult depression or violent behaviour, Dr. Mason said ""Some have hypothesized that children who engage in aggressive behaviour like fighting, pushing others and other problem behaviours become increasingly socially isolated during adolescence.  Their social failures may contribute to the development of depression."" ",0
380,273533,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315651.php,Majority of Americans think childhood vaccines are safe and necessary,Public Health,Public Health,Pediatrics / Children's Health,Infectious Diseases / Bacteria / Viruses,,3,2,3,3,1,4,4,4,4,1.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,,"
There has recently been a great deal of controversy surrounding childhood vaccination, with some people considering it unsafe or even unnecessary. 

The phenomenon of so-called vaccine hesitancy is not restricted to the U.S., as the World Health Organization (WHO) point out. Reluctance to accept child vaccinations has been noted in Europe, India, Japan, Nigeria, and Pakistan.      

In the U.S., some reports have shown that vaccine hesitancy increases the risk of disease outbreaks that could have otherwise been prevented by vaccines.

For instance, following a measles epidemic in California in December 2014, the California governor signed a piece of legislation that made vaccines compulsory for children in public or private schools and day cares. Of all 50 states, there are currently only two other states in the U.S. that no longer allow nonmedical exemptions to vaccines (such as on personal or religious grounds): Mississippi and West Virginia. 

Despite the controversy, the latest survey from the Pew Research Center suggests that the large majority of people in the country do, in fact, support vaccination. 

The survey - led by Cary Funk, associate director of research on society and science at the Pew Research Center - also details the demographic groups that regard vaccines with suspicion. 

The survey is based on nationally representative data gathered between May 10 and June 6 of 2016. 

A total of 1,549 adults were interviewed as part of the survey. Participants were 18 or older, from all 50 states across the U.S. and the District of Columbia. 

The survey found that a vast majority of Americans support the requirement that children enrolled in public schools be vaccinated for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). In fact, 82 percent said that they were in favor of this requirement, and 73 percent recognize the importance of vaccines for MMR prevention. 

Additionally, 63 percent of U.S. individuals consider the risk of side effects to be low.  

However, some groups still view vaccines with suspicion. The survey sheds light on some of the demographical differences among those who reject the preventive health benefits of childhood vaccination. 

""Public health benefits from vaccines hinge on very high levels of immunization in the population, so it is important to understand which groups hold reservations about the MMR vaccine,"" says lead author Funk.

Overall, the research found that black people, adults younger than 30, people who have tried alternative medicine, and people who are generally less informed about science seem to be more skeptical of health professionals and scientists. These groups also tend to perceive vaccine risks as higher and the benefits as lower than the rest of the population. 

White people were found to be more inclined to perceive the benefits of vaccination as high (79 percent) than black people (56 percent). More black people (44 percent) think that the risk of MMR vaccine side effects is medium or high, compared with 30 percent of white people. 


Additionally, 20 percent of people who have tried alternative medicine are more concerned with the adverse health effects of the vaccine, compared with only 8 percent of those who say have never taken over-the-counter medication for a cold or flu. 

There is also a generational gap regarding MMR vaccine perceptions. Seniors over the age of 65 overwhelmingly support the MMR vaccine requirement (90 percent) and think that it should be required by the school. Only 8 percent of them think that the decision should rather be left up to the parents.

By contrast, only 77 percent of adults aged between 18 and 29 believe that it should be a school-based requirement, and 21 percent of these adults think that parents should be allowed to decide whether to get their children vaccinated, even if it poses a health risk to others.  

Income and science knowledge also seem to play a role in vaccine risk perception. Ninety percent of those more knowledgeable about science see the benefits as particularly high and tend to support school-based vaccine requirements.   

One of the survey findings deemed ""striking"" by the lead author is the fact that parents of young children are more likely to be concerned about the vaccine. 


Over half of parents with children aged 4 or younger see the risk of side effects as low, but 43 percent see it as medium or high. By contrast, 70 percent of parents who do not have children younger than 4 years old perceive the risk as low, and only 29 percent of them say that the risk is medium or high.   

Lead author Funk comments on the research findings: 
 ""This survey looks in-depth at people's views about vaccines to explore which groups have more reservations about the MMR vaccine and whether or not those views are connected with people's trust in medical science. One of the striking findings in this study is that parents of young children express more concern about the safety of the MMR vaccine.

In a study of 81 overweight and obese women with type 2 diabetes who usually consumed diet beverages and were on a weight loss program, those who substituted water for diet beverages after their lunch for 24 weeks had a greater decrease in weight (-6.40 vs. -5.25 kg) and body mass index (-2.49 vs. -2.06 kg/m2) compared with those who continued to consume diet beverages. 

Participants who switched to water also experienced greater improvements in fasting blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity.

Study leader Dr. Tamlin Conner, of the Department of Psychology at the University of Otago in New Zealand, and colleagues found that young adults who were given extra fruits and vegetables each day for 14 days ate more of the produce and experienced a boost in motivation and vitality.

The researchers recently reported their findings in the journal PLOS One.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture, adults should aim to consume around two cups of fruits and around two to three cups of vegetables daily.

One cup of fruits is the equivalent to half a grapefruit or a large orange, and one cup of vegetables is proportionate to one large red pepper or a large, baked sweet potato.

As part of a healthful diet, fruits and vegetables can help reduce the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer. 

In recent years, studies have suggested that fruit and vegetable intake may also improve mental health. For their study, Dr. Conner and team set out to investigate this association further.

The researchers enrolled 171 students aged between 18 and 25 to their study, and they were divided into three groups for 2 weeks.

One group continued with their normal eating pattern, one group was personally handed two additional servings of fresh fruits and vegetables (including carrots, kiwi fruit, apples, and oranges) each day, while the remaining group was given prepaid produce vouchers and received text reminders to consume more fruits and vegetables.

At the beginning and end of the study, participants were subjected to psychological assessments that evaluated mood, vitality, motivation, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and other determinants of mental health and well-being.

The researchers found that participants who personally received extra fruits and vegetables consumed the most of these products over the 2 weeks, at 3.7 servings daily, and it was this group that experienced improvements in psychological well-being. In particular, these participants demonstrated improvements in vitality, motivation, and flourishing.

The other two groups showed no improvements in psychological well-being over the 2-week period.

Furthermore, no improvements were seen in symptoms of depression and anxiety in any of the groups. ""The majority of research linking depression to dietary patterns has been longitudinal, meaning that possible differences in ill-being may be established over a much longer period of time rather than our brief 2-week period,"" note the authors.

Still, the researchers say that their findings indicate that increasing the intake of fruits and vegetables through personal delivery may lead to rapid benefits for psychological well-being.

The team concludes that:
""Providing young adults with high-quality FV [fruits and vegetables], not texting them reminders to eat more FV and giving them a voucher, resulted in improvements to their psychological well-being over a 2-week period. 

This is the first study to show that providing high-quality FV to young adults can result in short-term improvements in vitality, flourishing, and motivation. Findings provide initial validation of a causal relationship between FV and well-being, suggesting that large-scale intervention studies are warranted.""

383,273609,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315727.php,"Whole grains may lead to a healthier gut, better immune responses",Nutrition / Diet,Nutrition / Diet,GastroIntestinal / Gastroenterology,Immune System / Vaccines,,3,2,3,3,3,2,4,5,3,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,,,,"
Senior study author Simin Nikbin Meydani, Ph.D., of the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston, MA, and colleagues report their findings in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

There are three components that make up a grain - the bran, germ, and endosperm. A whole grain contains all three components, whereas a refined grain is processed so that the bran and germ are removed.

Whole wheat, oats, rye, barley, brown rice, and quinoa are all examples of whole-grain products, while refined-grain products include wheat flour, white rice, and enriched bread.

Whole grains are considered a key part of a healthful diet. According to the American Heart Association, they can help to improve cholesterol levels, as well as reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.

Previous studies have suggested that whole grains reduce inflammation to produce such benefits. Meydani and colleagues set out to investigate this association further with their new study, noting that research comparing the effects of whole grains and refined grains on immune responses and inflammation has not controlled the diets of participants.

The 8-week study involved 81 healthy adults, all of whom consumed a Western-style diet high in refined grains for the first 2 weeks. 

For the remaining 6 weeks, 40 of the study participants continued with the Western-style diet that was rich in refined grains, while the remaining 41 participants were placed on a Western-style diet that was rich in whole grains.

Importantly, the team notes that the total energy, total fat, and total servings of fruits, vegetables, and proteins were comparable in each diet, meaning that the only difference between the two diets was the type of grains consumed.

All meals were preprepared by trained staff in line with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and they were designed for weight maintenance. The team explains that this was because previous studies had shown that increasing whole grain intake caused subjects to lose weight, which made it hard to determine whether reduced inflammation was a result of whole-grain consumption or weight loss.

Subjects were required to complete a food checklist with each meal, enabling the researchers to determine how much food each participant ate.

Furthermore, each participant was asked to continue with their usual physical activity, record the occurrence and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, and refrain from using any anti-inflammatory drugs (such as aspirin) in the 72 hours prior to blood samples being taken.

To evaluate how each diet influenced the gut microbiota - the population of microorganisms in the intestines - the researchers analyzed participants' stool samples. Blood samples were also collected, which the team used to assess immune responses.

Compared with participants who consumed the diet rich in refined grains, those who consumed the diet rich in whole grains showed an increase in a type of bacteria called Lachnospira, which is known to produce short-chain fatty acids.

The team explains that short-chain fatty acids are important for a healthy immune system.

Furthermore, subjects who consumed the whole-grain diet showed a reduction Enterobacteriaceae - bacteria that trigger inflammation. 

The researchers hypothesize that the decrease in Enteorbacteriaceae is down to the higher concentration of acetate identified in the stool samples of subjects who consumed the diet rich in whole grains.

On assessing the blood samples of both diet groups, the team found that subjects who consumed the whole-grain diet showed an increase in memory T cells - types of white blood cells that stave off infection.

When immune cells were stimulated with foreign compounds, however, participants who consumed the diet rich in refined grains showed a reduction in the production of TNF-alpha - a cell signaling protein involved in the first phase of an immune response.

The researchers stress that the differences in gut microbiota and immune responses were modest, but that their findings shed some light on how whole grains influence inflammation.

""The strength of the study is that we found modest effects of whole grain on gut microbiota and measures of immune function in the context of a controlled energy and macronutrient diet where all food was provided to participants, allowing them to maintain their body weight constant, thus eliminating the confounding effect of weight loss associated with increasing fiber consumption on immune and inflammatory markers,"" says Meydani.

""Additionally, our study incorporated markers of diet adherence and whole grain consumption, allowing us to more confidently determine the effect whole grains have on the gut microbiota and inflammatory responses.""

The researchers say that future studies should incorporate more soluble whole-grain products, which may give a clearer picture of how whole grains impact gut microbiota and immune responses.

Children commonly snore from time to time and that is often harmless. But children with frequent snoring and breathing problems during sleep have an increased risk of having trouble concentrating and learning difficulties. A newly published study from Sahlgrenska Academy shows that many parents of children that snore are not aware of the possible risks associated with frequent snoring in children.

Periodic snoring in children is not unusual. But, when snoring becomes persistent and the child experiences sleep apnea, sleep quality is affected. This, in turn, can lead to problems with daytime tiredness, concentration and learning difficulties, bedwetting and delayed growth.

A Swedish population study, that studied the occurrence of snoring and sleep apnea in 1300 children ranging in age from 0-11 years, found that approximately 5 percent of the examined children snored several times a week. Despite pronounced snoring, only about one third of the snoring children had sought medical help for their problem.

""Children with persistent snoring often have a reduced quality of life. In particular, this applies to children who have sleep apnea,"" says Gunnhildur Gudnadottir, Researcher at Sahlgrenska Academy. 

""The study shows that awareness is low regarding the negative effects of breathing disturbances during sleep on children's health and that most parents are not aware that this is something that should be investigated. An obvious result of the study is that we must consider how parents are given information about the condition and where they can seek help"" says Gunnhildur Gudnadottir.

The most common reason for snoring in children are enlarged tonsils or adenoids. In these cases, snoring can often be cured or reduced with surgery.
 
The Gothenburg researchers' advice is that children with severe recurrent snoring and sleep apnea should turn to a healthcare center for medical evaluation.",0

Babies born to pregnant women taking the epilepsy drug lamotrigine may not be at an increased risk of birth defects, such as cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot, according to a study published in the online issue of Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.
 
Lamotrigine is an epilepsy drug used on its own or in combination with other medications to control seizures; it is also prescribed to prevent mood swings for those with bipolar disorder. Maintaining effective epilepsy treatment during pregnancy is important because seizures may cause harm to the fetus.
 
""An initial study of this drug showed an increased risk for cleft lip or cleft palate, but a number of other studies since have not, and our previous study showed an increased risk of clubfoot,"" said study author Helen Dolk, PhD, of Ulster University in Northern Ireland, United Kingdom. ""This particular study had a much larger population size - more than double the size of our previous study.""
 
For the study, researchers looked at data on more than 10 million births during a span of 16 years. Of those, there were 226,806 babies with birth defects. Within that group, researchers found 147 babies who were exposed to the drug lamotrigine within the first trimester of pregnancy and who had non-genetic birth defects. Researchers found that babies with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot were not significantly more likely than babies with other birth defects to have been exposed to lamotrigine in the first trimester.
 
In the general population, one in every 700 babies is born with cleft lip or cleft palate, or 0.14 percent. Nearly one in 1,000 babies is born with clubfoot.
 
""We cannot exclude a small risk, but we estimate the excess risk of cleft lip or cleft palate among babies exposed to the drug to be less than one in every 550 babies. Since excess risks of cleft lip or palate have been reported for a variety of antiepileptic drugs, we recommend that for all mothers with epilepsy, whatever their drug exposure, special attention be given to examining the baby for cleft palate,"" said Dolk. ""We did not have specific information on lamotrigine dosage so additional study is recommended, especially of high doses.""
 
The study was funded by a grant from Glaxo Smith Kline, which approved the protocol for the study prior to contract, but was not involved in the conduct or management of the study, analysis or interpretation of data, or preparation of the paper.",0

Teenage pregnancy is widely recognized to be a major public health concern. These young mothers face many life challenges and they have an increased risk for becoming depressed. How might the behavior of these young mothers be related to later psychiatric or behavioral problems in some of their offspring? A new study published in  Biological Psychiatry  suggests an association between a history of  depression  in the mothers, a particular style of mothering, ""maternal overcontrol"", and increased  stress  reactivity of their infants.
   
Azar and colleagues measured the cortisol levels of infants both before and after a brief mild stressor. They found that a lifetime history of major depression in the mother and a maternal pattern of intrusive and overstimulating behavior toward their infant (""maternal overcontrol"") were associated with an increased release of the stress hormone, cortisol, in the infants following the mild stress exposure. The infants of mothers with a history of depression had also had lower pre-stress cortisol levels. Also, there was a correlation in the cortisol levels between mothers and their infants.
   
These findings add ""to our small but growing body of knowledge on neurobiological differences in stress responses between infants of depressed and non-depressed mothers"", noted Dr. Azar. John H. Krystal, M.D., Editor of Biological Psychiatry and affiliated with both Yale University School of Medicine and the VA Connecticut Healthcare System, adds, ""Teenage mothers and their offspring are both, in their own ways, vulnerable. As a result, teenage pregnancy is thought to be a setting for preventative educational programs that might help teenagers better cope with their upcoming challenges."" He also points out that, ""We do not yet know the long-term consequences of maternal 'overcontrol', but should it prove to have negative long-term effects, it is conceivable that this type of behavior might be targeted in preventive educational programs.""
   
Dr. Azar concludes, ""Practically, the open question is that of the long-term effects: are these infants at increased risk for psychological or physical stress-related illnesses later in life. If so, why"" Given that the adrenocortical system is known to be plastic and hence easily influenced in both positive and negative ways, we believe that it is very important to eventually identify which of these babies are more vulnerable to stress.""

According to an article in the Spring 2006 issue of  bp Magazine , a decrease in the amount of sugar you consume may actually sweeten your mood!    
 
The article reports that a 2002 study, published in Depression and Anxiety, has shown that countries with a higher sugar intake appear to have a higher rate of  depression .    
 
In addition, the 2005 Dietary Guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, state, ?the greater the consumption of foods containing large amounts of added sugars, the more difficult it is to consume enough nutrients without gaining weight.?    
 
Thus, the intake of nutrients important to good mental and physical health, like Vitamins A, B12 and C,  folate ,  calcium , phosphorus,  magnesium  and iron, tends to drop dramatically. This compounds the problems of  bipolar disorder  and weight gain.    
 
Karen Fink, a senior nutritionist at Timberlawn Mental Health System in Dallas, Texas, explains another problem. A sugar high can result in jitters or a temporary energy surge followed by an energy drop and feelings of lethargy. She notes, ?For those with bipolar disorder, this can accentuate their mood symptoms and make them feel worse.?    
 
One last, rather startling fact: One 12-ounce can of sweet soda a day add up to more than 50,000  calories  in a year. With no change in eating or exercise habits, you would gain about 15 pounds over that year.

For the first time researchers have identified the lifelong changes in gene expression in the brains of people born with Down syndrome (DS).

The findings, which appear in the journal Neuron, may lead to possible therapies for DS patients.

DS occurs in one out of every 691 live births and is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, affecting approximately 400,000 Americans. The underlying developmental and genetic causes of this intellectual disability in DS are not fully known and because of this lack of knowledge, no treatment is currently available. 

A multi-institution team of researchers led by Tarik Haydar, PhD, associate professor of anatomy and neurobiology at Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) and Nenad Sestan, MD/PhD professor of neuroscience at Yale School of Medicine, compared gene expression in different regions of the brains of humans with DS across development and adulthood. They discovered that the establishment of white matter in the brain, which is the insulation of the brain nerve fibers, (i.e. axons) is altered from toddler to adult periods of development. This finding was unexpected given the current theory that many changes leading to intellectual disability occur prenatally in DS. They also showed that the white matter changes in the brain are due to specific developmental defects in a class of brain cells called oligodendrocytes that form the white matter of the brain, and that this causes slower nerve transmission.
 
""This discovery of the genetic changes that alter communication within the brain uncovered a completely new target for therapies in the brains of people with DS,"" explained Haydar.  ""These findings may allow researchers to design strategies to promote brain functioning and improve quality of life, he added.

The researchers also believe these findings may have profound implications for individuals with other developmental disabilities, such as autism.

The videogames for health (G4H) field is pursuing innovative, potentially highly effective methods for changing behaviors and affecting health outcomes in children, but more research, defined guidelines and targeted funding are needed to drive game design, determine optimal use, and minimize possible adverse effects, according to a white paper published in Games for Health Journal: Research Development, and Clinical Applications, a peer-reviewed publication from Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.. The article is available free for download on the Games for Health Journal website until April 30, 2016.

A team of leading games for health researchers representing the Institute of Digital Media and Child Development Working Group on Games for Health, with lead author Tom Baranowski, PhD, Editor-in-Chief of Games for Health Journal, from USDA/ARS Children's Nutrition Research Center, and Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, collaborated on the white paper entitled ""Games for Health for Children--Current Status and Needed Research"".

The authors review what is currently known about G4H, including game design and how they can target specific behaviors and health-related factors such as games intended to reduce anxiety before surgery, to promote physical activity, or to educate about health. They also examine the implications of using G4H for child development. The article emphasizes the need to overcome cost and technology barriers that could impede access to G4H, and proposes the need for guidelines for children, parents, educators, clinicians, policymakers, and technologists related to factors such as screen time and game development.

""The available evidence reveals that Games for Health are very promising to prevent and treat obesity, reduce stress, prevent smoking, and contribute to many positive health outcomes among children. This White Paper offers a road map for the activities that need to occur to achieve that potential,"" says Dr. Baranowski.

In a review of research on the effect of meal patterns on health, the few studies available suggest that eating irregularly is linked to a higher risk of metabolic syndrome (high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and obesity). The limited evidence highlights the need for larger scale studies to better understand the impact of chrono-nutrition on public health, argue the authors of two new papers, particularly with the rise in shift workers and 'social jetlag' where many of us live by social clocks rather than our internal body clocks.

Our current lifestyle has become demanding and more irregular. Food consumption patterns have changed markedly over the past decades: more meals are skipped, consumed outside the family home, on-the-go, later in the day, and more irregularly. Two papers published in the Proceedings of the Nutrition Society explore the implications for health from different eating habits, reviewing the evidence from a number of dietary studies as well as global differences in eating habits.

Eating inconsistently may affect our internal body clock or 'circadian rhythms' which typically follow a 24-hour cycle. Many nutritionally related metabolic processes in the body follow a circadian pattern such as appetite, digestion and the metabolism of fat, cholesterol and glucose. Food intake can influence our internal clocks, particularly in organs such as the liver and intestine, whilst our central clock is also regulated by the dark/light cycle which in turn can affect food intake. Chrono-nutrition involves studying the impact of nutrition on metabolic processes and how these may be influenced by and also alter circadian patterns through nutrient intake (ir)regularity, frequency and clock time.

A number of studies have shown that people working shifts have an increased risk of a number of diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. For shift work, changes in dietary patterns are therefore an important aspect to consider when investigating its effects on health.

Social jetlag is estimated to affect more than 80% of the general population in central Europe, especially people living in urban areas. This discrepancy between our internal body clock and social clock has been linked to a greater risk of diseases like obesity and metabolic syndrome, whilst shorter periods of sleep have been linked to weight gain.

Consuming small but frequent meals to regulate appetite and weight is a concept that has been adopted in many fad diets, yet some studies have shown that a greater number of daily meals has been linked to a greater risk of obesity and thus one could argue that we should consume fewer meals per day, write the authors. However, without a reduced calorie intake, fewer meals are unlikely to bring major health benefits.

Moreover, when studying the impact of irregular meal patterns, it is also important to consider what people eat; some studies have found a link between how regularly people eat and what they choose to eat, for example with poorer food choices linked to breakfast skipping.

Along with studying the impact of what and when we eat, we should also consider 'with whom we eat', say the authors, pointing to evidence that regular family meals contribute to healthy eating habits in children and adolescents.

Globally, eating patterns vary widely according to the studies reviewed by the authors. The fact that lunch is the most important meal of the day is characteristic of France and the Mediterranean region, and reflects beliefs of the importance of pleasurable and social eating. Consequently, the French tend to eat together as a household more regularly and to follow a regular meal pattern of three meals a day. By contrast, in central England, drivers such as individual preferences and convenience dictate food choices, which translates to greater consumption of ready-prepared and take-away meals, more meal skipping and calorie-dense snack foods such as crisps.

In the UK and US, the proportion of energy intake increases gradually across the day, with breakfast providing the lowest proportion of energy and dinner the greatest. A shift towards greater energy intake at the evening meal has been reported in France in recent decades due to changing working patterns, although French eating patterns are not yet on par with those observed in England.

A recent clinical trial showed greater weight loss and improved blood sugar levels in overweight and obese women who ate more calories in the morning than in the evening. Further studies point to the importance of the ratio of evening-to-morning energy intake, and that evening intake may affect BMI differently based on whether people are regular or irregular consumers of breakfast.

Most national dietary guidelines focus on 'what' you should eat in terms of food and nutrients, with only a few also providing recommendations on 'when' you should eat over the course of a day. As such, further research is needed to shape future dietary guidelines, conclude the authors.

Dr Gerda Pot, Visiting Lecturer in the Diabetes and Nutritional Sciences Division at King's College London says: ""There seems to be some truth in the saying 'Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper', however, this warrants further investigation.""

""Whilst we have a much better understanding today of what we should be eating, we are still left with the question as to which meal should provide us with the most energy. Although the evidence suggests that eating more calories later in the evening is associated with obesity, we are still far from understanding whether our energy intake should be distributed equally across the day or whether breakfast should contribute the greatest proportion of energy, followed by lunch and dinner.""

Young people with  asthma  are about twice as likely to suffer from depressive and  anxiety  disorders than are children without asthma, according to a study by a research team in Seattle. Previous research had suggested a possible link in young people between asthma and some  mental health  problems, such as panic disorder, but this study is the first showing such a strong connection between the respiratory condition and depressive and anxiety disorders. The findings appear in the November issue of the  Journal of Adolescent Health. 
   
The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine, Group Health Cooperative, and Seattle Children's Hospital Research Institute. The researchers interviewed more than 1,300 youths, ages 11 to 17, who were enrolled in the Group Health Cooperative health maintenance organization. Of the participants, 781 had been diagnosed with or treated for asthma, and the rest were randomly selected youths with no history of asthma.
   
About 16 percent of the young people with asthma had depressive or anxiety disorders, the researchers found, compared to about 9 percent of youth without asthma. When controlling for other possible variables, youth with asthma were about 1.9 times as likely to have such depressive or anxiety disorders.
   
Researchers tested for several depressive and anxiety disorders, including  depression , a mood disorder called dysthymia, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety, social  phobia , and  agoraphobia . These disorders are somewhat common in youth, and are associated with high risk for school problems, early pregnancy, adverse health behaviors like smoking or lack of exercise, and suicide.
   
Young people with depressive and anxiety disorders often find it harder to manage their asthma and describe more impaired physical functioning because of the combination of asthma and a depressive or anxiety disorder, the researchers said. Youth with asthma and one of the disorders are also more likely to smoke, making their asthma more difficult to treat.
   
""Physicians treating young people with asthma should realize that those children are at a greater risk of depressive and anxiety disorders, and should try to educate patients and their families about this increased risk,"" said Dr. Wayne Katon, professor and vice-chair of psychiatry at the UW School of Medicine, and corresponding author of the study. ""The primary care system is correctly identifying only about 40 percent of the cases in which children with asthma also have a psychiatric disorder. We should improve our screening for these disorders, and develop effective treatment programs for affected patients that address both asthma and the depressive or anxiety disorder.""
   
In addition to exploring the link between asthma and depressive and anxiety disorders, researchers found other variables that further increase the risk of such disorders. Female respondents were at a greater risk of depressive and anxiety disorders, as were youth living in a single-parent household, those who had been diagnosed with asthma more recently, and those with more impairment in asthma-related physical health.

Cardiovascular disease, including heart disease and stroke, kills more than 800,000 Americans each year. We know that too much salt may contribute to high blood pressure and increased cardiovascular risk. According to a new study in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, American children are consuming sodium at levels that far exceed the daily recommended limit. Taste preferences for high sodium foods, formed as children, follow individuals into adulthood and put them at increased risk for developing cardiovascular problems later in life. 
 
""Sodium reduction is considered a key public health strategy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases nationwide and this study is the latest in ongoing CDC efforts to monitor U.S. sodium intake,"" explained lead author Zerleen S. Quader, MPH, a data analyst with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention. ""We already know that nearly all Americans regardless of age, race, and gender consume more sodium than is recommended for a healthy diet and the excess intake is of great concern among particular youths.""

Using data from the 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), CDC researchers looked at the eating habits of 2,142 children between the ages of 6 and 18 years. They found that the average sodium intake for kids was 3,256 milligrams per day, not including any salt added at the table. The recommended intake for children varies from 1,900 mg/day to 2,300 mg/day depending on age. Nearly 90% of the children surveyed exceeded the upper level of sodium recommended for their age group and previous evidence suggests that one in nine children ages 8-17 years already has blood pressure above the normal range for their age, sex, and height, which increases their risk of high blood pressure as adults.

The study also found that high levels of sodium were being consumed throughout the day and from a variety of different sources. For example, they found 39% of sodium was consumed at dinner, 31% came from lunch, 16% from snacks, and 14% at breakfast. Researchers discovered that only 10 types of food made up almost 50% of kids' sodium intake. These included pizza, Mexican mixed dishes, sandwiches (including burgers), breads, cold cuts, soups, savory snacks, cheese, plain milk, and poultry.

Looking at where sodium-laden foods were purchased, researchers found that foods from the grocery store accounted for a substantial 58% of daily sodium intake, while fast-food/pizza contributed 16%, and the school cafeteria 10%. ""With the exception of plain milk, which naturally contains sodium, the top ten food categories contributing to U.S. school children's sodium intake in 2011-2012 comprised foods in which sodium is added during processing or preparation,"" said Quader. ""Sodium is consumed throughout the day from multiple foods and locations, highlighting the importance of sodium reduction across the U.S. food supply.""

While sodium intake exceeded daily recommended levels across the board, the study found that average levels were even higher for teens ages 14-18 years (3,565 mg/day vs. 3,256 mg/day for all ages) and that girls had significantly lower daily intake than boys (2,919 mg/day for girls vs. 3,584 mg/day for boys); however, no significant differences in mean sodium intake were observed by race/ethnic group, household income, or child weight status. 

This new study illustrates why identifying targets for sodium intervention can be tricky, since salt is ubiquitous in children's diets. It's also hard to pinpoint problem foods, since the sodium content of dishes can vary significantly according to how they are made and prepared. ""It's surprising how much sodium content for the same food type can vary by product,"" described Quader. ""The best way to reduce sodium intake from these products is to check the Nutrition Facts panel on packages and look for no-salt-added or lower-sodium versions.""

The investigators have identified some important tips for parents and caregivers looking to help cut down sodium in kids' diets: 
 
While more attention is being paid to fostering good food habits early, salt could prove to be a challenging opponent. Researchers hope that this study can serve as a benchmark as more measures are put into place to reduce the amount of sodium kids consume. ""The results support the need to reduce sodium content across the U.S. food supply rather than in a single type of food or venue,"" concluded Quader. ""These data provide baseline information on sources of sodium intake among U.S. school-aged children that can be used to monitor changes in the food supply over time.""

The humble avocado, shunned for years during the fat-free diet craze of the 1990s, may have finally hit its stride. No longer just for guacamole, this nutritious fruit is popping up as a healthy addition to various diet plans.

But can people with diabetes eat this food? It turns out that avocados are not only safe for people with diabetes, but they may be downright beneficial. Research shows that avocados offer many ways to help people manage their diabetes and improve their overall well-being.

Contents of this article:

A healthy diet is critical for people with diabetes. The foods that they eat each day can have a considerable impact on how they feel and how well their diabetes is controlled. 

In general, people with diabetes should eat foods that help control blood sugar levels and that offer health benefits such lowering blood pressure and cholesterol. This is one of the best ways to keep diabetes under control, avoid complications, and lead the healthiest life possible. 

Avocados are an excellent choice for people with diabetes because they offer all these benefits - and possibly more.

Blood sugar control is critical for people who have diabetes. A physician or dietitian may advise patients to choose foods that are lower in carbohydrates and sugar. They may also recommend foods that help control blood sugar spikes. An avocado meets both of these requirements.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture, an average medium avocado has around 17 grams of carbohydrates. For comparison, an apple has 25 grams of carbohydrates and a banana has 27.

A 1-ounce serving, or about one-fifth of an avocado, contains only 3 grams of carbohydrates and less than 1 gram of sugar.

With so few carbohydrates, people with diabetes likely won't need to worry about an avocado raising their blood sugar levels.

Pairing an avocado with other foods may help reduce blood sugar spikes too. Its fat and fiber content takes longer to digest and slows the absorption of other carbohydrates in the process.

Before people make any significant changes to their diet, they should talk with their physician or dietitian. One of the things to consider is total calorie intake. 

A whole avocado contains 250-300 calories, but a 1-ounce serving has only 50. People who are watching their calories in order to maintain or lose weight can still add avocado to their diet. This can be done by switching a serving of avocado for something else with a similar amount of calories like cheese or mayonnaise.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) say people should pay attention to the type of fat they're eating more than the amount.

Specifically, people should strictly limit the unhealthy fats. This includes saturated fats and trans fats, often found in fatty meats, fried foods, processed and restaurant foods.

The ADA encourage people with diabetes to consider adding avocado into their diets due to its healthy fats.

Avocados have fat and are calorie-dense, but this is not a reason for people with diabetes to avoid them. 

The fats in avocados are mostly monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), which have been shown to raise ""good"" HDL cholesterol. MUFAs can also lower levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and fats called triglycerides, and reduce blood pressure. 

Having healthy cholesterol, triglyceride, and blood pressure levels can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).

People with diabetes are twice as likely to have heart disease and stroke as someone without diabetes, according to the NIDDK. More importantly, heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death among people with diabetes. 

There may be an additional reason that MUFAs are a ticket to better health when living with diabetes. A study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition suggests that these fats may help control blood sugar and insulin levels.

The researchers found this was particularly the case when replacing some carbohydrates in the diet with MUFAs. So besides being naturally low in sugar and carbohydrates, an avocado's healthy fats can help lower blood sugar levels even more.

A medium avocado has an impressive 10 grams of fiber. For reference, men should get 30-38 grams of fiber per day, and women need 21-25 grams, according to the Academy of Nutrition of Dietetics. 

Fiber is an important part of a healthy diet because it improves digestive health and keeps the bowels regular. It's particularly helpful for people with diabetes because it helps improve blood sugar levels.

A study in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine suggests that fiber can lower fasting blood sugar levels and hemoglobin A1C levels in people with diabetes.

Soluble fiber, which is present in avocados, may also improve cholesterol levels, according to a study in the American Journal for Clinical Nutrition. This is another way this fruit may help reduce the risk of heart disease.

Avocados may also help people feel fuller for longer. This can help people control their calorie intake without feeling hungry. A study in the Nutrition Journal found that eating half of an avocado with lunch increased levels of feeling full up to 5 hours later.

Avocados offer a buttery yet versatile flavor that can be added to a variety of salads, sandwiches, and sweet and savory dishes. 

Although avocados require no cooking, it is best to eat one when it's ripe. A ripe avocado will be dark in color and will feel slightly soft when squeezed gently.

If an avocado is firm and green in color, it should be left to ripen for a few days. Avocados ripen off the tree, and many found at the store need some time to reach their ideal ripeness.

The following is another way of telling if an avocado is ripe or not:

Spread 1 to 2 teaspoons of avocado on whole grain toast instead of butter. Adding a dash of black pepper and garlic, a tomato slice, or some fresh salsa can give it extra flavor. Combine it with favorite vegetables and seasonings.

Another option is a baked avocado egg. Slice the avocado in half and remove the pit. Crack an egg, place it in the avocado half, and bake for 15-20 minutes at 425°F. Top with diced tomatoes, salsa, peppers, or other vegetables.

Slices of avocado make a great addition to nearly any salad. They also work well as a topping for vegetable or chicken wraps and turkey burgers. Avocado can also be used in a sandwich in place of mayonnaise or butter.

Adding a mashed up avocado to store-bought hummus gives a boost of fiber and healthy fats. Skip the chips and instead, dip fresh, crunchy vegetables like carrots and celery sticks.

Avocados naturally pair well with fish tacos, enchiladas, or other Mexican dishes. They can also be used as a topping on chili in place of sour cream. Sprinkle diced avocado on a whole-grain pizza and cut back on the cheese.

Avocados may be a healthy boost to a diabetes meal plan. People with diabetes should talk with their doctor or dietitian about their dietary needs, and consider giving avocado a try at their next meal.

In America, more than 30 million people have a diabetes diagnosis.

Of these cases, around 5 percent are classed as type 1 diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes, usually diagnosed in young adults and children, is an autoimmune disorder; it is sometimes referred to as juvenile diabetes.

The individual's immune system attacks and destroys specific cells within the pancreas - islet cells - that create insulin.

With the following decrease in insulin, blood glucose builds up and damages nerves and blood vessels.

The exact causes of type 1 diabetes are not understood; both genes and environmental factors are thought to play a role.

For unknown reasons, the number of type 1 diabetes diagnoses is rising. According to some estimates, globally, type 1 diabetes is increasing by 3 percent year on year. 

One theory to explain the increase in type 1 diabetes involves the interaction between antibiotics and gut bacteria. The microorganisms that live in our gut - the microbiome, or ""healthy"" bacteria - have evolved alongside humanity and are now indispensable to our normal functioning.

Incredibly, there are more bacteria living within us than there are cells in our body. You could say that we are more them than us. 

Among other roles, some believe that the gut biome helps train the developing immune system to not be overly sensitive. In other words, by being introduced to microbes as we grow, the immune system learns to be less trigger-happy.

Over recent years, childrens' exposure to microbe-destroying antibiotics has steadily risen. By the age of 10, the average American child has received 10 courses of antibiotics.

A study, carried out at NYU Langone Medical Center and published in Nature Biology this week, set out to investigate this theory. The study used a mouse model of type 1 diabetes and doses of antibiotics equivalent to those given to children.

The team was led by Dr. Martin Blaser, The Muriel G. and George W. Singer Professor of Translational Medicine at NYU School of Medicine. They used non-obese diabetic mice (NOD), which are susceptible to developing type 1 diabetes.

The NOD mice were either given continuous low-dose antibiotics or pulsed antibiotic therapy (PAT), which is more similar to the type of doses children often experience.

When the mice were tested at the end of the trial, 53 percent of those exposed to PAT had developed type 1 diabetes, compared with 26 percent of the control mice that received no antibiotics.

As Dr. Blaser says: ""Our study begins to clarify the mechanisms by which antibiotic-driven changes in gut microbiomes may increase risk for type 1 diabetes.""

Each mouse's gut bacteria was sampled before, during, and after the study to measure any changes in number and species.

The changes were profound. In the 3-month-old PAT mice, one specific species of gut bacteria - which has previously been shown to help train the immune system - had almost totally disappeared. In each of the three bacteria-sampling tests, the PAT mice's bacterial diversity was reduced when compared with the control mice.

To assess the ability of the changed gut flora to affect health, the team carried out a further experiment. They transferred the gut bacteria of a PAT mouse into the gut of a mouse bred to have none of its own gut flora (germ-free mice).

After the transfer was complete, the researchers observed similar changes in their immune system; this proves that the changes in gut bacteria alone (independent of antibiotics) can make significant changes to the developing immune system. 
""This is the first study of its kind suggesting that antibiotic use can alter the microbiota and have lasting effects on immunological and metabolic development, resulting in autoimmunity. 

We're eager to see how these findings may impact the discovery of type 1 diabetes preventive treatments in the future and continued research in the area of vaccines.""Jessica Dunne, director of Discovery Research at Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation
These findings have huge implications for national health. As the researchers admit, these are preliminary studies and will need to be replicated; however, they could influence the way in which antibiotics are administered further down the line.

Providing a voice to an often 
silent disease, Epocrates, Inc. surveyed 500 clinicians to identify trends 
in  depression  diagnosis, prevalence and treatment. People dealing with 
 stress , whether in the workplace or at home, should take note; nearly all 
clinicians identified stress as the leading contributor to depression.     


The majority of clinicians reported seeing an increase in depression in 
the past five years, and believe this increase may be driven by greater 
disease awareness, and ultimately more patients seeking help. However, 
clinicians reported that many more patients may be experiencing symptoms 
that are going undiagnosed. More than half of survey respondents felt that 
physicians are hesitant to diagnose depression, primarily due to resistance 
from patients and lack of societal acceptance. Clinicians also reported 
uncertainty about diagnosing depression, as patients may present symptoms 
differently based on gender and ethnicity, or may be a product of another 
medical illness.    

    
""In today's digital age, the increasing pressure to get it done 
yesterday can lead to more stress and potentially depression. Early 
recognition and intervention are important to prevent the loss of jobs, 
damage to relationships or  suicidal thoughts ,"" said John Luo, MD, Assistant  
Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience 
and Human Behavior.    

    
The vast majority of clinicians reported recommending prescription 
therapies for their patients experiencing depression. Beyond 
pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, 60 percent of respondents believe 
lifestyle changes such as diet, exercise and meditation may also be helpful 
in treating depression, depending on the patient's individual situation.   
 Additional key survey findings include:    

    -- Gender makes a difference when diagnosing depression    

       -- Thirty percent of clinicians reported being less likely to discuss 
          depression with men.    

       -- Clinicians reported it is often more difficult to treat men because 
          they are less ""open"" than women, and symptoms such as anger or 
           addiction  may not be immediately linked to depression.     

    -- Clinicians may be more likely to experience depression    

       -- More than 50 percent of clinicians reported experiencing depression 
          at some point in their lives, which compared to the National 
          Institutes of Health data, could make them more than twice as likely 
          to experience depression as the general public.    

       -- Additionally, 12 percent of clinicians reported missing work because 
          they felt depressed. Clinicians are not alone-a national study 
          revealed that depression is the leading cause of missed work days, 
          and lost productivity due to depression is estimated at $83 billion 
          a year.

Dieters sometimes consume extra protein to stave off hunger and prevent loss of muscle tissue that often comes with weight loss.

But in a study of 34 postmenopausal women with obesity, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis found that eating too much protein eliminates an important health benefit of weight loss: improvement in insulin sensitivity, which is critical to lowering diabetes risk.

The findings are available in the journal Cell Reports.

""We found that women who lost weight eating a high-protein diet didn't experience any improvements in insulin sensitivity,"" said principal investigator Bettina Mittendorfer, PhD, a professor of medicine. ""However, women who lost weight while eating less protein were significantly more sensitive to insulin at the conclusion of the study. That's important because in many overweight and obese people, insulin does not effectively control blood-sugar levels, and eventually the result is type 2 diabetes.""

Insulin sensitivity is a good marker of metabolic health, one that typically improves with weight loss. In fact, the women in the study who lost weight while consuming less protein experienced a 25 to 30 percent improvement in their sensitivity to insulin.

Mittendorfer and her colleagues studied 34 women with obesity who were 50 to 65 years of age. Although all of the women had body mass indices (BMI) of at least 30 - a BMI of 30 or more indicates significant obesity - none had diabetes.

Dietitian Sue Waller (left) shows a meal to Mary Akin (center), one of the patients in a study conducted by Bettina Mittendorfer, PhD. Women in the study were provided food over the course of the research.

The participants were randomly placed into one of three groups for the 28-week study. In the control group, women were asked to maintain their weight. In another group, the women ate a weight-loss diet that included the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of protein: 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. For a 55-year-old woman who weighs 180 pounds, that would come to about 65 grams of protein per day.

In the third group, the women ate a diet designed to help lose weight, but they consumed more protein, taking in 1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight, or almost 100 grams for that same 180-pound woman.

""We provided all of the meals, and all the women ate the same base diet,"" Mittendorfer explained. ""The only thing we modified was protein content, with very minimal changes in the amount of fat or carbohydrates. We wanted to hone in on the effects of protein in weight loss.""

The researchers focused on protein because in postmenopausal women, there is a common belief that consuming extra protein can help preserve lean tissue, keeping them from losing too much muscle while they lose fat.

""When you lose weight, about two-thirds of it tends to be fat tissue, and the other third is lean tissue,"" Mittendorfer said. ""The women who ate more protein did tend to lose a little bit less lean tissue, but the total difference was only about a pound. We question whether there's a significant clinical benefit to such a small difference.""

The women who ate the recommended amount of protein saw big benefits in metabolism, led by a 25 to 30 percent improvement in their insulin sensitivity. Such improvements lower the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The women on the high-protein diet, meanwhile, did not experience those improvements.

""Changing the protein content has very big effects,"" Mittendorfer said. ""It's not that the metabolic benefits of weight loss were diminished - they were completely abolished in women who consumed high-protein diets, even though they lost the same, substantial amounts of weight as women who ate the diet that was lower in protein.""

It's still not clear why insulin sensitivity didn't improve in the high-protein group, and Mittendorfer said it's not known whether the same results would occur in men or in women already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. She plans to continue researching the subject.

The study, led by Elizabeth D'Amico, senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation - an American nonprofit global policy organization - was recently published in the journal Addiction.

Alcohol and marijuana use are common among adolescents in the United States.

Approximately 8.7 million youths aged 12-20 report having consumed alcohol in the past month, while 6.5 percent of 8th-grade students and 14.8 percent of 10th-graders in the U.S. currently use marijuana.

For their study, D'Amico and colleagues set out to investigate how alcohol consumption and marijuana use in middle and high school might influence academic outcomes.

The research involved  6,509 youths from 16 middle schools across Southern California - all of whom were part of an alcohol and drug use prevention program called CHOICE.

Between the ages of 11 ½ and 17 years - spanning from middle to high school - the students completed a total of seven surveys, in which they were asked about their use of alcohol and marijuana. 

The final survey they completed also asked about their academic performance, as well as social functioning, delinquent behavior, and mental and physical health.

Compared with youths who engaged in lower or no alcohol and marijuana use during middle and high school, those with greater use were found to have poorer academic preparedness and were more likely to have delinquent behavior.

Furthermore, youths who engaged in greater marijuana use alone during middle and high school were found to have poorer academic performance and poorer mental health.
""Many youth tend to think that alcohol use has more consequences than marijuana use and therefore view marijuana use as safer than drinking.

However, youth need to better understand the harms of marijuana use, such as the potential effect on their developing brain and how it can affect performance in both adolescence and adulthood.""Elizabeth D'Amico
White youths were more likely to engage in alcohol and marijuana use than non-white youths, according to the team.

However, the researchers found that Hispanic and multi-ethnic youths were at greater risk of poorer academic performance as a result of higher marijuana and alcohol use, compared with white youths.

Additionally, Asian, black, and Hispanic youths were found to be at greater risk of poorer academic preparedness than white youths, while Asian and multi-ethnic youths had poorer physical health.

Dr. D'Amico says their findings highlight the need to address alcohol and marijuana use early on, particularly for non-white adolescents.

""One approach may be to increase protective factors such as parental support or the adolescent's ability to resist temptations to use these substances,"" she adds.

The researchers note that there are some limitations to their study. For example, they did not account for racial discrimination, parental involvement, or neighborhood quality - factors that may have influenced alcohol and marijuana use or academic and mental functioning during the study period.

Senior author Dr. Ponusammy Saravanan, of the University of Warwick Medical School in the United Kingdom, and colleagues present their preliminary findings at this week's Society for Endocrinology annual conference in the U.K.

Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin naturally present in animal products, such as milk, eggs, cheese, meat, poultry, and fish. It is also available as a dietary supplement and added to some non-animal products, such as breakfast cereals.

According to the National Institutes of Health, vitamin B12 aids a number of bodily functions, including red blood cell formation, DNA synthesis, and neurological functioning.

The recommended daily vitamin B12 intake for individuals aged 14 and older is 2.4 micrograms, increasing slightly to 2.6 micrograms for expectant mothers, and 2.8 micrograms while breast-feeding.

Dr. Saravanan and colleagues say previous research has shown that women with low vitamin B12 levels during pregnancy are more likely to have a higher body mass index (BMI) and have low-birth-weight babies with high cholesterol. 

Additionally, such research has shown these babies have greater insulin resistance in childhood, raising their risk for type 2 diabetes.

Dr. Saravanan and team set out to determine whether these previous observations might be associated with leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells. Often referred to as the ""satiety hormone,"" leptin tells us when it is time to stop eating.

Research has shown that excess weight can cause an increase in leptin levels in response to food intake. This can cause leptin resistance, which may lead to further overeating, weight gain, and insulin resistance, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes.

For their study, the researchers analyzed 91 blood samples taken from mothers and their offspring at delivery to determine vitamin B12 levels. Additionally, they analyzed 42 maternal and neonate fat tissue samples and 83 placental tissue samples.

The researchers found that children born to mothers with vitamin B12 deficiency - defined as less than 150 picomoles per liter - were more likely to have higher-than-normal leptin levels, which may raise their risk of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders.

The team speculates that vitamin B12 deficiency in expectant mothers may affect leptin gene programming, altering production of the hormone during fetal development.
""The nutritional environment provided by the mother can permanently program the baby's health. We know that children born to under or overnourished mothers are at an increased risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes, and we also see that maternal B12 deficiency may affect fat metabolism and contribute to this risk. This is why we decided to investigate leptin, the fat cell hormone.""Dr. Ponusammy Saravanan
At present, the researchers are unable to pinpoint the precise mechanisms by which maternal vitamin B12 deficiency increases leptin levels for offspring, but they do have some theories.

""Either low B12 drives fat accumulation in the fetus, and this leads to increased leptin, or the low B12 actually causes chemical changes in the placental genes that produce leptin, making more of the hormone,"" says study co-author Dr. Adaikala Antonysunil, also of the University of Warwick.

""As B12 is involved in methylation reactions in the body which can affect whether genes are turned on and off, we suspect it may be the latter,"" he adds.

With further study, the researchers hope to prove their suspicion true. If their findings are confirmed, the team says the current recommendations for vitamin B12 during pregnancy may need to be reviewed.

A program that helps parents talk to their children about  skin cancer  risks may promote sun-safe behaviors, especially when parents and children have a high-quality relationship, according to a report in the August issue of Archives of Dermatology, one of the JAMA/Archives journals.
   
Approximately one in six individuals will develop skin cancer during his or her lifetime, according to background information in the article. The recent increase in skin cancer incidence has been attributed to various forms of high-risk sun exposure among young people, including sunbathing, inadequate use of sunscreen and other protective measures and the use of tanning beds or lamps. Recent preventive interventions have targeted children in school or community settings, but widespread rates of dangerous behaviors persist in young people.
   
Rob Turrisi, Ph.D., The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, and colleagues evaluated a parent-based intervention and assessed family characteristics that may contribute to the effectiveness of such a program in 469 parent-child pairs. Of those, 340 were assigned to the intervention group, in which parents received a handbook that encouraged them to communicate skin cancer risks, promote safe behaviors and discourage tanning, sunbathing and other high-risk activities. The other 129 were assigned to the control group. The children were all 9 to 12 years old, in fourth through sixth grade and from southern Idaho or eastern Tennessee. Forty-five days after parents in the intervention group received the handbook, children in both groups underwent an assessment in which they were asked questions about their sun-related habits and their family dynamics.
   
Among children who were in the intervention group, several family variables increased the effectiveness of the program. Children in the intervention who exhibited average levels of compliance--measured by how often they reported obeying their parents or following their parents' rules--had less frequent sunburns than those in the control group, but those with above-average compliance developed even fewer sunburns. Among children who reported that their parents had a low level of monitoring--for instance, that parents do not typically know where a child is or is going--the intervention had a larger effect on  sunburn  severity than among those who reported that their parents monitored them closely. The quality of the parent-child relationship, the child's level of compliance and the frequency of negative communication all affected sunbathing tendencies among those in the intervention group--the program was most effective in families with a high-quality parent-child relationship, a high level of compliance and a low level of negative communication.
   
The findings are consistent with current theories regarding effective parenting, the authors write. ""Since the intervention was parent based, it follows that if the child feels that the parent encompasses many general positive qualities (e.g., the parent is warm, loving, trusting and a good listener and shows respect for the child), the child will be more likely to listen to his or her parents about issues such as skin cancer risks,"" they continue. ""Furthermore, if the child is willing to comply with parental demands, the parent will have more influence in encouraging sun-safe behaviors and discouraging unsafe sun-related behaviors. Also, it is important that the parent does not exhibit negative communication patterns that can negate the effectiveness of positive communication.
   
""Finally, when parents are already aware of their child's activities, they are more capable of making sure that their child is adequately protected from the sun, which can prevent severe burns,"" they conclude. ""Parents can be viable change agents for child behavior and the quality of the family relationship is critical to the success of such interventions.""

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimate that in the United States, more than 53 million people have osteoporosis already or are at an increased risk of developing it because they have low bone density. 


Osteoporosis is a condition in which the bone strength is reduced, leading to a higher risk of bone fractures - in fact, the disease is the leading cause of bone fractures in postmenopausal women and the elderly. 

Most bone fractures occur in the hip, wrist, and spine. Of these, hip fractures tend to be the most serious, as they require hospitalization and surgery. 

It used to be believed that osteoporosis was a natural part of aging, but most medical experts now agree that the condition can and should be prevented. 

New research from the Ohio State University found a link between nutrition and osteoporosis.  The study was led by Tonya Orchard, an assistant professor of human nutrition at the Ohio State University, and the findings were published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Density. 


Orchard and team investigated data from the Women's Health Initiative (WIH) study and compared levels of inflammatory nutrients in the diet with bone mineral density (BMD) levels and fracture incidence. 

The WIH is the largest health study of postmenopausal women ever conducted in the U.S. Women were enrolled in the study between 1993 and 1998. 

The researchers used the dietary inflammatory index (DII) and correlated the measurements with the risk of hip, lower-arm and total fracture using data from the longitudinal study.  

They then assessed the changes in BMD and DII scores. The researchers distributed food frequency questionnaires to 160,191 women aged 63 on average, who had not reported a history of hip fracture at the beginning of the study. 

Researchers used BMD data from 10,290 of these women and collected fracture data from the entire group. The women were clinically followed for 6 years.  

Orchard and team used Cox models to calculate fracture hazard ratios and adjust for age, race, ethnicity, and other variables. 

The scientists found an association between highly inflammatory diets and fracture - but only in younger Caucasian women. 

Specificallly, higher scores on the DII correlated with an almost 50 percent higher risk of hip fracture in white women younger than 63 years old. By contrast, women with the least inflammatory diets lost less bone density during the 6-year period than their high DII counterparts, even though they had overall lower bone mass when they enrolled in the study. 

As the authors note, these findings suggest that a high-quality, anti-inflammatory diet - which is typically rich in fruit, vegetables, fish, whole grains, and nuts - may be especially important for younger white women. 
""[Our study] suggests that as women age, healthy diets are impacting their bones. I think this gives us yet another reason to support the recommendations for a healthy diet in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.""Tonya Orchard 
Rebecca Jackson, the study's senior author and director of Ohio State's Center for Clinical and Translational Science, adds that their findings confirm previous studies, which have shown inflammatory factors to increase osteoporosis risk. 

""By looking at the full diet rather than individual nutrients, these data provide a foundation for studying how components of the diet might interact to provide benefit and better inform women's health and lifestyle choices,"" Jackson says. 

However, it is worth noting that the study did not associate a more inflammatory diet with a higher risk of fracture overall. On the contrary, lower-arm and total fracture risk were found to be slightly lower among women with higher DII scores. 

Although the study was observational and could not establish causality, a possible explanation ventured by the authors is that women with lower inflammatory diets may exercise more and have a higher risk of falls as a consequence.

People with  diabetes  who have repeated  panic attacks  are less likely to have properly managed the disease and suffer more severe health complications and poorer quality of life, a new study finds.   

Lead author Evette Ludman, Ph.D., a researcher with Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, said her group's previous work showed  depression  was associated with more poorly controlled glucose, more diabetes symptom, and lower functioning. ""But because panic and depression so often go hand in hand, we weren't certain that patients who have panic, independent of depression, would also have with these indicators.""   

For the new study, which appears in the November issue of  General Hospital Psychiatry , a survey was mailed to 4,385 patients with diabetes. Of those participants, 193 (4.4 percent) reported having panic episodes that caused a definite change in behavior. Among the 193 patients, 54.5 percent also had symptoms of depression.   

Respondents were asked about recent panic or fear ""spells"" and if these feelings forced them to change their behavior. Participants were also given questionnaires that measured their diabetes symptoms as well as their level of functioning and disability.   

Of those with panic disorder, the average HbA1c levels - a measure of long-term glucose control - were 8.1 percent compared with 7.7 percent for those without panic episodes. (Usual treatment goal is to keep levels below 7 percent.) Also, those with panic episodes reported having an average of 4.2 diabetes symptoms compared with 2.4 symptoms in those without panic.   

Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent panic attacks, followed by persistent worry about having another attack.   

The authors say that panic symptoms might be a consequence of diabetes itself. Panic episodes may contribute to poor outcomes by interfering with self-care and patients' ability to follow their treatment regimens.   

The authors and diabetes experts agree that if physicians treating patients with diabetes can better recognize and treat the symptoms of panic episodes and depression, they can improve the patients' quality of life.   

""I think most careful clinicians have noted that there are patients who do not cope well with their diabetes and have a variety of neuropsychosocial issues including panic disorder, depression,  anxiety  and  personality disorders ,"" said John Buse, M.D., division chief of the Diabetes Center at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""The key really is to very carefully assess patients who are not doing well in their management of diabetes or other chronic illness.""

Women who put in long hours for the bulk of their careers may pay a steep price: life-threatening illnesses, including heart disease and cancer.
 
Work weeks that averaged 60 hours per week or more over three decades appear to triple the risk of diabetes, cancer, heart trouble and arthritis for women, according to new research from The Ohio State University.
 
The risk begins to climb when women put in more than 40 hours and takes a decidedly bad turn above 50 hours, researchers found.
 
""Women - especially women who have to juggle multiple roles - feel the effects of intensive work experiences and that can set the table for a variety of illnesses and disability,"" said Allard Dembe, professor of health services management and policy and lead author of the study, published online this week in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.
 
""People don't think that much about how their early work experiences affect them down the road,"" he said. ""Women in their 20s, 30s and 40s are setting themselves up for problems later in life.""
 
Men with tough work schedules appeared to fare much better, found the researchers, who analyzed data from interviews with almost 7,500 people who were part of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.
 
Women tend to take on the lion's share of family responsibility and may face more pressure and stress than men when they work long hours, previous research shows. On top of that, work for women may be less satisfying because of the need to balance work demands with family obligations, Dembe said.
 
Employers and government regulators should be aware of the risks, especially to women who are required to regularly toil beyond a 40-hour work week, he said. Companies benefit in terms of quality of work and medical costs when their workers are healthier, Dembe said.
 
More scheduling flexibility and on-the-job health coaching, screening and support could go a long way toward reducing the chances employees become sick or die as a result of chronic conditions, he said.
 
The researchers analyzed the relationship between serious disease and hours worked over a 32-year period.
 
Previous research has shown that workers who put in long hours face more stress, have more sleep and digestive trouble and are more fatigued. Their work performance suffers and they have more injuries on the job.
 
But prior to this study, efforts to examine a connection between long hours and chronic illness have had mixed results, in large part because it's difficult to obtain long-term data on work patterns and health, Dembe said.
 
This study used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, administered by Ohio State's Center for Human Resource Research and sponsored by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which includes interviews with more than 12,000 Americans born between 1957 and 1964.
 
Dembe and his collaborator, Mayo Clinic researcher and former Ohio State doctoral student Xiaoxi Yao, examined data for survey participants who were at least 40 in 1998, when interview questions began to include questions about health status and chronic conditions.
 
They averaged the self-reported hours worked each week over 32 years and compared the hours worked to the incidence of eight chronic diseases: heart disease, cancer (except skin cancer), arthritis or rheumatism, diabetes or high blood sugar, chronic lung disease including bronchitis or emphysema, asthma, depression and high blood pressure. They also examined the results by gender.
 
A minority of the full-time workers in the study put in 40 hours or fewer per week. Fifty-six percent worked an average of 41 to 50 hours; 13 percent worked an average of 51-60 hours; and 3 percent averaged more than 60 hours.
 
The results among female workers were striking, Dembe said. The analysis found a clear and strong relationship between long hours and heart disease, cancer, arthritis and diabetes.
 
Men who worked long hours had a higher incidence of arthritis, but none of the other chronic diseases. And those men who worked moderately long hours (41 to 50 hours weekly) had lower risk of heart disease, lung disease and depression than those who worked 40 hours or fewer.
 
Because the data addresses chronic diseases reported by age 40 or 50, this study speaks only to early-onset disease and doesn't shed light on the possible associations between long hours and lifetime risks, which could prove even more profound, Dembe said.
 
""The early onset and identification of chronic diseases may not only reduce individuals' life expectancy and quality of life, but also increase health care costs in the long term,"" Dembe and Yao wrote in the paper.
 
One limitation of the study is that it relies on average hours per week and doesn't provide answers about the differences between those who consistently worked long hours and those whose careers were full of long hours at first but who found themselves with more free time later on, the researchers said.
 
It also does not address the potential differences between mandatory overtime and discretionary overtime.
 
""It could make a difference,"" Dembe said. ""You might still be working hard, but the fact that it's your choice might help you stay healthier.""
 
The study was supported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.

A new study by researchers at King's College London has found that patients with diabetes suffering from the early stages of kidney disease have a deficiency of the protective 'anti-ageing' hormone, Klotho.

The study, published in Diabetologia (the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [EASD]), suggests that Klotho may play a significant role in the development of kidney disease, which is often prevalent in patients with diabetes.

This could mean that Klotho levels have the potential to be used as a risk marker to predict kidney disease, as well as being a target for developing new treatments to prevent kidney disease in patients with type 1 diabetes.

Previous work undertaken at King's has also shown that Klotho protects the vascular system against changes associated with abnormal ageing, such as the thickening of artery walls (atherosclerosis), which characterises age related disorders such as diabetes, heart disease and hypertension.

In this study, scientists tested blood and urine samples from 78 patients with type 1 diabetes of which 33 also showed signs of the early stages of diabetic kidney disease, called microalbuminuria.

They found that patients with microalbuminuria had lower levels of the circulating Klotho hormone, compared with patients without microalbuminuria. Klotho levels in patients without microalbuminuria were similar to levels found in healthy adults.

First author of the study, Dr Giuseppe Maltese, from the Cardiovascular Division at King's College London said: 'For the first time, Klotho has been linked to kidney disease in type 1 diabetes patients and this finding represents an exciting step towards developing new markers for disease and potentially new treatments.'

Senior author, Dr Janaka Karalliedde, said: 'With further research using larger cohorts of patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes we hope to expand the scope of this work to identify at an early stage patients at high risk of progression of kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.'

Dr Richard Siow, a co-author of the study, recently published research which showed the protective effects of Klotho in cardiovascular cells and said: 'This study highlights the important clinical and basic science research that is being undertaken on Klotho at King's.

'Our research will help scientists to better understand the mechanisms by which this hormone benefits healthy ageing, as well as how deficits in Klotho lead to age related diseases. We are conducting further research on the role of Klotho in ageing and longevity as part of ARK (Ageing Research at King's) research initiatives.'

Limitations of this study include its relatively small and selective sample size and the cross-sectional design, which is unable to identify a causal relationship between Klotho and development of kidney disease.

What is more, the study shows the soda giants campaigned against at least 28 public health bills over the same period that aimed to lower soda intake and improve the American diet.

Lead author Daniel Aaron and co-author Dr. Michael Siegel, of the Boston University School of Medicine, publish their findings in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

The researchers say their results suggest big drink companies are hampering efforts to improve health and nutrition in the U.S., and they call for health organizations to refuse funding from these companies.

Sugary drink consumption has become a major public health concern in recent years, with links to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

But it seems there are some industries that have long tried to dampen reports of the health risks of these beverages; a study published last month, for example, revealed how the sugar industry accepted money as early as 1965 to mute the link between sugar intake and heart disease.

The new study from Aaron and Dr. Siegel adds fuel to the fire, providing insight into the funding national health organizations have received from soda giants over the past 5 years.

Aaron and Dr. Siegel reached their findings by investigating data on which health organizations received funding from Coca-Cola between 2011-2015, as well as what health bills the two soda giants lobbied against.

Over the 5-year period, the team identified a total of 96 national health organizations that accepted money from the companies. Of these, 83 accepted money from Coca-Cola, one accepted money from PepsiCo, and 12 accepted money from both companies.

Unlike Coca-Cola, PepsiCo does not publish a list of organizations it provides finance to, so the researchers say it is likely that even more health organizations received funding.

The team was surprised to find that the American Diabetes Association and the Diabetes Research Foundation were two of the organizations that accepted funding from the soda companies, given the well-established link between sugary drink intake and diabetes.

From their analysis, the researchers also found that Coca-Cola and PepsiCo lobbied against 28 health bills or proposed regulations between 2011-2015, such as proposals to tax sugary drinks.

Coca-Cola spent more than $6 million a year campaigning against health bills and proposals between 2011-2014, the team reports, while PepsiCo spent more than $3 million annually.

Additionally, the researchers found the American Beverage Association - the trade association that ""represents America's non-alcoholic beverage industry"" - spent $1 million a year lobbying between 2011-2014.

The researchers say - just like previous investigations into the tobacco and alcohol industries - their results suggest the soda industry is using ""corporate philanthropy"" as a marketing tool to ""silence health organizations that might otherwise lobby and support public health measures against these industries.""
""The soda companies can neutralize potential legislative opposition by invoking reciprocity and financial dependence from national health organizations. 

Rather than supporting public health, organizations may become unwitting partners in a corporate marketing strategy that undermines public health."" Daniel Aaron
Aaron and Dr. Siegel recommend that health organizations refuse sponsorship from the soda industry and seek out alternative funding in order to avoid becoming involved in a corporate marketing strategy.

The study forms the first part of a four-paper series published by The Lancet that provides an overview and update of worldwide trends of physical activity and the global impact of physical inactivity. 

The first series observing physical activity was released in 2012 ahead of the Summer Olympic Games. The study authors caution that there has been little progress in tackling the global pandemic of physical activity since the 2012 Olympics, with a quarter of adults worldwide failing to meet physical activity recommendations.

In the analysis, the researchers posed the question: Does exercise reduce or eradicate the harmful effects - including increased risk of early death - that are associated with prolonged sitting?

Health risks that are linked to physical inactivity include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers, with recent estimates suggesting that more than 5 million people die each year globally due to failing to meet daily activity levels.

Findings from the second part of the series - a world-first study to estimate the economic burden of physical inactivity worldwide - shows that globally in healthcare expenditure and lost productivity, physical inactivity cost the world $67 billion in 2013.

""Physical inactivity is recognized as a global pandemic that not only leads to diseases and early deaths, but imposes a major burden to the economy,"" says Dr. Melody Ding, senior research fellow at The University of Sydney's School of Public Health, Australia.

Dr. Ding notes that if no action is taken to improve population levels of physical inactivity, the economic burden of physical inactivity is projected to increase globally, predominantly in low- and middle-income countries.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that adults aged 18-64 should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week.

In the first paper of the series, the researchers analyzed 16 studies, which included data from over 1 million people. 

The team formed four groups of individuals based on their level of moderate-intensity exercise, ranging from 5-75 minutes per day. Moderate-intensity exercise was defined as walking 3.5 miles per hour or cycling at 10 miles per hour.

Results from the study show that people that spend 8 hours a day sitting but are physically active have a significantly lower risk of death than people who spend fewer hours sitting, but who are not physically active.

Moreover, the increased risk of death associated with spending 8 hours sitting was eliminated by 1 hour of physical activity per day.

People who had the greatest risk of death were those individuals who sat for prolonged periods and were mostly inactive. They were between 28-59 percent more likely to die early, compared with those in the most active group, which is a similar risk to that associated with smoking and obesity.

The study finds that only around 25 percent of participants did an hour or more exercise per day.

""There has been a lot of concern about the health risks associated with today's more sedentary lifestyles,"" says Prof. Ulf Ekelund, of the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences, Norway, and the Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom. 

""Our message is a positive one: it is possible to reduce - or even eliminate - these risks if we are active enough, even without having to take up sports or go to the gym.""
Prof. Ulf Ekelund
""For many people who commute to work and have office-based jobs, there is no way to escape sitting for prolonged periods of time. For these people in particular, we cannot stress enough the importance of getting exercise, whether it's getting out for a walk at lunchtime, going for a run in the morning or cycling to work. An hour of physical activity per day is the ideal, but if this is unmanageable, then at least doing some exercise each day can help reduce the risk,"" he adds.

Also observed in the study was time spent watching TV per day - a particular type of sedentary behavior - in a subgroup of approximately half a million people.

Watching TV for 3 hours per day was associated with an increased risk of death in all activity groups, except among the most active. The authors say that this association could be because long hours watching TV may be a marker of a more unhealthy lifestyle in general, including being less likely to take exercise.

In a third paper in the series looking at the progress and challenges in physical activity since the 2012 Olympics, Prof. Jim Sallis, of the University of California-San Diego, says: ""The global pandemic of physical inactivity remains, and the global response has been far too slow.""

The fourth and final paper highlights the need for collaboration between schools, transport, sports, and recreation and environmental sectors to increase levels of physical activity and monitor physical inactivity as a risk factor for negative health impacts.

""Large-scale problems require large-scale solutions, and we need commitment from governments, as well as international organizations to tackle the global public health challenge of physical inactivity. Science and practice are providing important evidence, but now is the time for action,"" says Prof. Rodrigo Reis, of Washington University in St Louis, MO.

Dr. Pam Das, senior executive editor, and Dr. Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet,  say in a linked comment: ""The world needs to get serious about physical activity. And that means money - for capacity in public health departments to undertake adequate surveillance, cross-sector partnerships, interventions, policy monitoring, and research, especially the cost-effectiveness of interventions.""

""There is extensive evidence about the need for action to improve physical activity, what actions are most promising, and who needs to be involved. But capacity and funding remain insufficient because physical activity is not taken seriously enough to rise to the top of the funding priorities,"" they conclude.

Results of the study are published in the journal Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics.

The researchers - led by Cristobal Miranda, a research assistant professor at the university - found specific intake levels of the hops flavonoid, called xanthohumol, which improved metabolic syndrome markers in laboratory mice.

According to the American Heart Association (AHA), the underlying causes of metabolic syndrome are overweight and obesity, physical inactivity and genetic factors. Risks associated with the condition can be reduced by lowering weight, increasing physical activity and eating a heart-healthy diet.

Being clinically diagnosed with three or more of several conditions is what defines metabolic syndrome. These conditions include: abdominal obesity, elevated lipids, high blood pressure, insulin resistance or impaired glucose tolerance.

The researchers note that obesity and its related disorders account for up to 10% of health care expenditures in the US. 

Previously, xanthohumol has been researched for its potential health benefits, alongside other flavonoids found in tea, garlic, chocolate, apples and blueberries. 

Earlier this year, a study published in The BMJ suggested eating more flavonoid-rich fruits and vegetables to prevent weight gain, for example.

To investigate what levels of xanthohumol have an effect on metabolic syndrome, the researchers gave varying levels of the flavonoid to laboratory mice that were fed a high-fat diet. 

Results showed that, compared with animals that were not given any xanthohumol, the laboratory mice that were given the highest dosage had an 80% reduction in their LDL - or ""bad"" - cholesterol. In addition, their insulin levels dropped 42%, and their IL-6 levels, which is a biomarker of inflammation, dropped by 78%.

Furthermore, the researchers found that although the mice given the flavonoid were still growing - because they were eating a rich diet and becoming obese - their weight increased by 22% less than those not receiving xanthohumol. This is despite the fact that they all ate the same amount of food.

Interestingly, the researchers say consuming the flavonoid seems to increase oxygen consumption and metabolic rate, which has major implications for weight control.

Commenting on their findings, Miranda says:

""This is the first time we've seen one compound with the potential to address so many health problems. These were very dramatic improvements.""

Through the study, the researchers were also able to pinpoint one of the mechanisms of the flavonoid. Apparently, it lowers plasma levels of PCSK9, which is a protein that acts on cholesterol levels. 

They hope that lowering levels of this protein will help to clear LDL cholesterol from the blood.

Before using this study as a free pass to drink copious amounts of beer, however, the researchers suggest looking closely at the doses used in the study.

Although xanthohumol is found naturally in hops and beer, the study used 60 mg per kg of body weight per day, which is the human equivalent of 350 mg for a person weighing 70 kg (154 lbs) per day.

In short, this would mean that a human adult would have to drink 3,500 pints of beer each day to get the correct intake as reported in the study. Though this would not be possible - or advisable to undertake - the researchers say this amount of xanthohumol could be obtained through a dietary supplement.

Although their results are very promising, the researchers note that more research needs to be undertaken to show safety and efficacy in humans. 

""Work is still needed to further demonstrate the safety of high dosages of xanthohumol,"" says Prof. Fred Stevens, study corresponding author, ""but dosages 15-30 times higher than we used have already been given to animals with no apparent problems.""

He adds that ""this might provide an effective treatment for metabolic syndrome at a very low cost.""

Researchers here have linked an increase in two immune system proteins essential for  inflammation  to a latent viral infection and proposed a chain of events that might accelerate cardiovascular disease.   

The same process may be involved in a host of other ailments plaguing the elderly.   

The findings also suggest that chronic  depression  may play a key role in starting the cascade that can lead to the buildup of plaques clogging coronary arteries.   

The researchers' report, their latest in a nearly three decade long effort to understand the role psychological  stress  plays in weakening the immune system, was published in the journal Brain, Behavior and Immunity.   

Ronald Glaser, a professor of molecular virology, immunology and medical genetics at Ohio State University, said, ""To me, this suggests a new way of thinking about how these diseases develop. We carry around these latent  herpes  viruses in our bodies virtually all our lives and periodically they can hurt us, inducing biological events that could lead to an increased risk of  atherosclerosis .""   

Glaser, head of Ohio State's Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research, has focused for years on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), one of eight different herpesviruses that can remain dormant in the body for a lifetime.   

""Perhaps more than 90 percent of the people in North America have been infected by EBV by the time they're adults,"" Glaser said. ""Virtually everybody in the country is carrying this virus.""   

Glaser, James Waldman, an associate professor of pathology, Marshall Williams, a professor of molecular virology, immunology and medical genetics, and Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, a professor of psychiatry and psychology, initially focused on the role that two essential proteins interleukin-6 (IL-6) and  tumor  necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) -- play in producing inflammation, a major part of the body's immune response.   

As the immune system ages, the levels of IL-6 in the body increase in the blood. Some of that IL-6 is created by immune cells called macrophages that rush to the site of an infection or injury. Earlier work by the team also showed that increases in psychological stress and depression can substantially raise the levels of IL-6 and TNF-a in the body.   

Increased stress and depression can also trigger the latent virus to reactivate and begin reproducing inside cells   

The researchers also knew that as Epstein-Barr virus begins to multiply in cells in the body, it produces a protein called dUTpase that, in turn, can stimulate macrophages to make even more IL-6.   

""The more IL-6 levels rise in the body, the greater a person's risk is for disease,"" Glaser said, adding that IL-6 increases, as well as depression, have been associated with cardiovascular disease,  osteoporosis  and type-2  diabetes .   

The researchers developed a model to test these linkages by using endothelial cells that line the inside of veins in umbilical cord tissue. They wanted to see how the cells themselves, as well as the immune macrophages, reacted when exposed to the virus as well as the dUTpase protein.   

In those experiments, the production of IL-6, as well as TNF-a, were increased just as they would be as part of the inflammatory process in the body. Such chronic incidents of inflammation are integral to the onset of atherosclerosis, Waldman said, as well as other diseases.   

""Basically, we're seeing all of these factors as playing a significant role in the production of these proinflammatory proteins,"" he said. ""We were very surprised to find all these connections. They weren't expected.   

""This may help us understand just how atherosclerotic disease may occur, or how it is exacerbated by many factors.""   
 The researchers point to one value of their findings:   

""People need to remember how important depression is, and that when they're depressed, it can reactivate these viruses, starting the cascade that leads to inflammation, perhaps increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, according to Glaser.   

""So treating depression is very important,"" he said.

The research is being presented at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress by study author Dr. Lucio Mos, a cardiologist at Hospital of San Daniele del Friuli in Udine, Italy.

""There is controversy surrounding the long-term cardiovascular and metabolic effects of coffee consumption in patients with hypertension,"" Dr. Mos reports. ""Our study was designed to evaluate whether coffee drinking had an effect on the risk of cardiovascular events, and if the association was mediated by effects on blood pressure and glucose metabolism.""

Such is coffee's popularity around the world, there is a wide variety of research that has been conducted on the effects of its consumption. Recently, Medical News Today has reported on studies that have suggested coffee could improve survival in colon cancer patients and reduce the risk of erectile dysfunction.

However, the majority of studies of coffee that MNT has looked at in recent months have linked coffee consumption with positive health outcomes. The new study differs in this respect.

The researchers investigated the coffee consumption habits of 1,201 non-diabetic patients aged 18-45 years participating in the prospective HARVEST2 study. Each participant had stage 1 hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 140-159 mm/Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure of 90-99 mm/Hg) but were not receiving treatment for it.

Coffee consumption was defined by the amount of cups of caffeine-containing coffee participants drank every day. Non-drinkers reported no cups a day, moderate drinkers consumed between one and three cups daily and heavy coffee drinkers consumed four or more per day.

Among the participants of the study, 26.3% did not drink coffee, 62.7% were moderate coffee drinkers and 10% were heavy coffee drinkers.

Type 2 diabetes is frequently known to develop in patients with hypertension at a later stage, and so the researchers investigated how coffee drinking influenced the risk of developing prediabetes over time, following the participants for 12.5 years.

How quickly the participants metabolized caffeine - determined by the CYP1A2 genotype - influenced this risk. Only in heavy coffee drinkers who metabolized caffeine slowly did the risk of prediabetes increase significantly.

""Slow caffeine metabolizers have longer exposure to the detrimental effects of caffeine on glucose metabolism,"" Dr. Mos explains. ""The risk is even greater if they are overweight or obese, and if they are heavy coffee drinkers. Thus, the effect of coffee on prediabetes depends on the amount of daily coffee intake and genetic background.""

During the study's follow-up period, a total of 60 cardiovascular events were observed, with the majority of these (80%) being heart attacks. 

Both heavy and moderate consumption of coffee were independent predictors of cardiovascular events, although these risks were reduced when including hypertension development and future prediabetes in the analysis, after which the only significant relationship was with heavy coffee consumption.

Dr. Mos concludes that the study shows coffee use is linearly associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in young adults with mild hypertension:

""This relationship seems to be at least partially mediated by the long-term effect of coffee on blood pressure and glucose metabolism. These patients should be aware that coffee consumption may increase their risk of developing more severe hypertension and diabetes in later life and should keep consumption to a minimum.""

Last year, MNT reported on a meta-analysis that found genetic reasons for why caffeine has different effects on different people, potentially explaining certain people's coffee drinking habits.

Nutrition policies that have centered on the mismatch between ""calories in and energy out"" in the belief that all calories are equal, have ""failed miserably over the past 30 years,"" disputes Dr. Artemis Simopoulos, of the Center for Genetics, Nutrition, and Health in Washington, D.C., and Dr. James DiNicolantonio, of Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas.

Drs. Simopoulos and DiNicolantonio note - in an editorial published in the online journal Open Heart - that humans evolved on a diet that had equal amounts of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. This intrinsic balance is critical to babies' development during pregnancy and breast-feeding, and in preventing and managing chronic diseases.

Now, this 1:1 ratio has been replaced by an omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of 16:1. This substantial ratio difference has emerged as a consequence of significant changes in the food supply over the last 100 years. 

Food technology and modern agriculture have led to production of vegetable oils - such as sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, soybean, and corn - rich in omega-6 fatty acids, and a swap in animal feeds from grass to grain. Traditionally, animals grazed on grass containing omega-3, whereas the grains, corn, and soy that they are now fed are high in omega-6.

The change in oils and animal feed has increased levels of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid - two types of omega-6. Linoleic acid levels have soared in the diet from oils and arachidonic acid from meat, eggs, and dairy.

High dietary intake of omega-6 has several adverse outcomes, according to researchers. The high levels of omega-6 can lead to increased white fatty tissue and chronic inflammation, which are both hallmarks of obesity and linked to type 2 diabetes, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and cancer.

Omega-6 can also prevent the browning of white fatty tissue to ""good"" energy-burning brown fatty tissue and can increase the risk of blood clotting.

While the body needs both omega-3 and omega-6, the balance between the two is crucial, say the researchers. Fatty acids act directly on the nervous system, influencing food intake and sensitivity of the hormones involved in blood sugar control and appetite suppression.

Omega-3 and omega-6 are metabolically and functionally different. Previous studies have linked omega-3 fatty acids to a decrease in the development of fatty tissue and weight loss, while high concentrations of omega-6 have been associated with an increased risk of weight gain

The authors point out that different populations metabolize fatty acids differently, which makes them more or less at risk of the consequence of an imbalance. The authors write:

""The time has come to return the omega-3 fatty acids in the food supply and decrease the omega-6 fatty acids by changing the cooking oils and eating less meat and more fish. The composition of the food supply must also change to be consistent with the evolutionary aspects of diet and the genetics of the population.""

""The scientific evidence to balance the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is robust and necessary for normal growth and development, prevention and treatment of obesity and its comorbidities including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer,"" they add.

Drs. Simopoulos and DiNicolantonio say that these objectives can be accomplished by studies focusing on the metabolism of nutrients, genes, and their function.

""It is the responsibility of the governments and international organizations to establish nutrition policies based on science and not continue along the same path of focusing exclusively on calories and energy expenditure, which have failed miserably over the past 30 years,"" they conclude.

People who sleep five or fewer hours a night are likely to also drink significantly more sugary caffeinated drinks, such as sodas and energy drinks, according to a new study of more than 18,000 adults led by UC San Francisco scientists.

The authors emphasize that it's not yet clear whether drinking sugar-sweetened beverages causes people to sleep less, or whether sleep deprivation makes people seek out more sugar and caffeine to stay awake, though previous research suggests both could be true.

""We think there may be a positive feedback loop where sugary drinks and sleep loss reinforce one another, making it harder for people to eliminate their unhealthy sugar habit,"" said lead author Aric A. Prather, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry at UCSF. ""This data suggests that improving people's sleep could potentially help them break out of the cycle and cut down on their sugar intake, which we know to be linked to metabolic disease.""

The study was published online and will be included in the December 2016 issue of Sleep Health.

A growing body of research has linked sugary beverage consumption to metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions including high blood sugar and excess body fat, which can lead to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Lack of sleep is also associated with a higher risk for metabolic disease. Recently, several studies have linked the two factors in school-age children, showing that children who get less sleep are more likely to drink soda and other sugary beverages during the day, said Prather, who is also associate director of the UCSF Center for Health and Community.

To understand whether this is a more general pattern in the adult population, Prather and his team analyzed the 2005-2012 records of 18,779 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES), an ongoing study of dietary habits and health status in a nationally representative sample of US adults administered by the National Center for Health Statistics. The study includes participants' reports of how much sleep they usually got during the work week, as well as their total consumption of various beverages, including caffeinated and non-caffeinated sugar-sweetened beverages, fruit juice, drinks with artificial sweeteners, and plain coffee, tea and water.

After controlling for a host of sociodemographic factors and health variables that could potentially impact sugary beverage consumption and sleep, the researchers found that people who regularly slept five or fewer hours per night also drank 21 percent more caffeinated sugar-sweetened beverages - including both sodas and non-carbonated energy drinks - than those who slept seven to eight hours a night. People who slept six hours per night regularly consumed 11 percent more caffeinated sugar-sweetened beverages. On the other hand, the team found no association between sleep duration and consumption of juice, tea or diet drinks.

Prather noted that previous research has strongly indicated that sleep deprivation increases hunger, particularly hunger for sugary and fatty foods.

""Short sleepers may seek out caffeinated sugar-sweetened beverages to increase alertness and stave off daytime sleepiness,"" he said. ""However, it's not clear whether drinking such beverages affects sleep patterns, or if people who don't sleep much are more driven to consume them. Unfortunately, the data in the current study do not allow us to draw any conclusions about cause and effect.""

Additionally, said Prather, sleep duration figures in the study were based on self-reporting, which might not accurately reflect the participants' true sleep patterns. ""It will be important to have additional studies with more objective measures of sleep such as EEG recordings or wearable sleep monitors,"" he said. ""We also need long-term prospective studies to better understand how sleep and sugary beverage consumption affect one another over time.""

Whatever the relationship between sugar and sleep, said Prather, the study may point to a new way to address the problem of excess sugar consumption.

""Sleeping too little and drinking too many sugary drinks have both been linked to negative metabolic health outcomes, including obesity,"" said Prather. ""Given the likely two-way relationship between sugary drinks and short sleep, enhancing the duration and quality of sleep could be a useful new intervention for improving the health and well-being of people who drink a lot of sugary beverages.""

Current cigarette use was reported by 11 percent of high school students in 2015. This is a significant decrease from the 28 percent recorded in 1991.

The information comes from the results of the 2015 edition of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). The YRBS was first introduced in 1991 to collect information on student behaviors that could pose a risk to health.

""Health risk behaviors among youth vary over time and across the nation, making the YRBS an important tool to better understand youth,"" explains Laura Kann, Ph.D., chief of the CDC's School-Based Surveillance Branch.

""The YRBS helps us identify newly emerging behaviors and monitor long-standing youth risk behaviors over time,"" she adds.

A significant fall in cigarette use among high school students can only be good news. According to the CDC, smoking is the leading cause of preventable death. In the United States, cigarette smoking is responsible for over 480,000 deaths per year.

While cigarette smoking has fallen among high school students, the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has risen. The survey results reveal that 24 percent of high school students stated they had used e-cigarettes during the past 30 days.

The CDC class e-cigarettes as tobacco products and using them as a risky behavior. As a result, these findings remain a concern for them.

""Current cigarette smoking is at an all-time low, which is great news,"" states Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC. ""However, it's troubling to see that students are engaging in new risk behaviors, such as using e-cigarettes.""

""We must continue to invest in programs that help reduce all forms of tobacco use, including e-cigarettes, among youth,"" he adds.

It may be that students are avoiding traditional cigarettes in favor of e-cigarettes. Earlier in the year, a joint report from the CDC and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggested that tobacco use in youths had remained stable since 2011.

Things could change over the next few months, however. Last month, the FDA passed a new rule that restricts the sale of e-cigarettes to minors. 

Elsewhere in the survey results, the researchers observed a fall in fighting among high school students. A total of 23 percent of students reported having been in a physical fight over the past 12 months in 2015, compared with 42 percent in 1991.

Soda appears to be less popular among high school students. The number who reported drinking soda one or more times a day fell from 27 percent in 2013 to 20 percent in 2015.

Prescription drug use among youth fell from 20 percent in 2009 to 17 percent in 2015. Sexual activity, defined as having had intercourse in the past 3 months, also fell from 38 percent in 1991 to  30 percent in 2015.

However, condom use among sexually active youth fell slightly, dropping from 59 percent in 2013 to 57 percent in 2015.

Another significant finding is that a large number of high school students continue to put others at risk by using wireless devices while driving. Across 35 states, the number of students who had texted or emailed while driving ranged from 26 to 63 percent.

Overall, the number of students who had texted or emailed while driving during the past 30 days was 42 percent. This figure had not changed from 2013.

The number of students playing video and computer games also rose significantly. The number rose from 22 percent in 2003 to 42 percent in 2015.

""While overall trends for the 2015 report are positive, the results highlight the continued need for improvements in reducing risks among teens,"" Kann concludes.

Study co-leader Dr. Mara Dierssen, of the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) in Barcelona, Spain, and colleagues reveal how the compound epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) improved the cognitive function of individuals with the condition.

According to the researchers, their study represents the first time a treatment has shown some improvement in cognitive skills for people with Down syndrome.

According to the National Down Syndrome Society, around 1 in every 691 babies in the United States are born with Down syndrome, and there are more than 400,000 Americans living with the condition.

Down syndrome is the most common genetic condition in the U.S., occurring when an individual has a partial or full additional copy of chromosome 21, meaning they have three copies of this chromosome, rather than the normal two.

This extra chromosome leads to overexpression of genes, which can cause a number of physical symptoms, including reduced muscle tone, a small head, ears, and mouth, a flattened facial profile, and upward-slanting eyes.

Individuals with Down syndrome may also experience problems with cognitive function, such as delayed language and speech development, learning and memory impairments, and poor concentration.

According to Dr. Dierssen and colleagues, research has shown that such cognitive impairments are down to overexpression of a gene called DYRK1A, and studies in mice have suggested the compound EGCG could reduce DYRK1A overexpression.

Now, the new study indicates that the compound could do the same for people with Down syndrome, achieving an improvement in cognitive function.

EGCG is a compound present in green tea. It belongs to a class of antioxidants known as polyphenols, which studies have shown protect the body against cell damage that can cause human disease.

For their study, Dr. Dierssen and colleagues enrolled 84 individuals aged 16-34 who had Down syndrome.

For 12 months, participants were randomized to receive a daily dose of decaffeinated green tea containing EGCG - 9 milligrams per kilogram - or a placebo. Both groups also underwent weekly cognitive training.

The trial was double-blind, meaning the researchers, the participants, and their families were unaware of what treatment each subject received.

All participants underwent cognitive tests and brain imaging at 3, 6, and 12 months, as well as 6 months after treatment had ceased.

Compared with participants who were treated with the placebo, the researchers found that those treated with EGCG scored much better in certain areas of cognitive function.

Specifically, they showed significant improvements in three areas:

Furthermore, on assessing the brain scans of each participant, the team found that those who were treated with EGCG showed greater functional connectivity between nerve cells than those who received the placebo.

""It was surprising to see how the changes are not just cognitive - in the reasoning, learning, memory and attention capacities - but suggest that the functional connectivity of the neurons in the brain was also modified,"" says study co-leader Dr. Rafael de la Torre, of the Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain. 

Overall, the researchers believe their results indicate that EGCG may be an effective treatment for people with Down syndrome.
""This is the first time that a treatment has shown some efficacy in the improvement of some cognitive tasks in persons with this syndrome.

It must be made clear that our discovery is not a cure for Down syndrome and that our results have to be proven in larger populations, but it may be a treatment to improve these individuals' quality of life."" Dr. Mara Dierssen
As well as further trials investigating the efficacy and safety of EGCG in larger cohorts, the team plans to assess how the green tea compound may impact the cognitive functioning of children with Down syndrome.

""Our results have been already marginally positive in the adult population, in which cerebral plasticity is limited because the brain is already completely developed,"" the authors note. ""We believe that if the treatment is applied to children, the results might be even better.""

Drinking during early to mid-adolescence can lead to vulnerability to chronic stress, according to new research from Binghamton University, State University of New York.

A research team led by Linda Spear, distinguished professor of psychology at Binghamton University, gave alcohol to rats every other day, starting from early to mid-adolescence. When the team looked at the same rats in adulthood, they found that adult males didn't show hormonal stress adaptation, making them more vulnerable to chronic stress.

""Stress hormones are released when you get anxious or are in a stressful circumstance,"" said Spear. ""The classic stress hormone is cortisol in humans; it's corticosterone in rats. When you expose the animals to a stressor, the first time they show a large hormone stress response. However, this hormonal response normally adapts over time, such that less hormone is released following repeated exposure to a relatively mild stressor. And that's important, because cortisol or corticosterone helps you respond to an emergency. But it's bad to have elevated levels in the long term, because sustained elevations in these levels of these hormones have adverse effects on a lot of body systems. So cortisol is needed for emergencies, but you don't want it elevated all the time. And what we found is that following adolescent alcohol exposure, adults don't show that hormonal stress adaptation. They don't adapt to the chronic stressor, which suggests that they may be more vulnerable later to chronic stress.""

Spear's work is a part of a national consortium, funded by the National Institute of Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse, that's examining, using animal models, the effects of alcohol exposure during adolescence.

""I think what these studies are showing is that there are long-lasting effects from adolescent alcohol exposure, and it is not innocuous. And these effects are most dramatic with exposures during mid- and early adolescence, which is the time when alcohol use is typically initiated in humans.

Study co-author Katri Räikkönen, from the University of Helsinki in Finland, and colleagues hypothesize that glycyrrhizin (the active ingredient in licorice) may interfere with fetal neurodevelopment by increasing levels of ""the stress hormone"" cortisol.

The researchers recently reported their findings in the American Journal of Epidemiology.

Though licorice is often hailed for its medicinal benefits - such as the alleviation of peptic ulcers and canker sores - studies have indicated that the plant-derived product has some downsides.

A study reported by Medical News Today in November, for example, associated licorice intake with reduced fertility for women, and studies have also suggested that licorice consumption during pregnancy may lead to poorer birth outcomes, such as a lower birth weight.

For this latest study, Räikkönen and team investigated how licorice intake during pregnancy might influence cognitive functioning and behavior in offspring.

The researchers explain that licorice's active ingredient, glycyrrhizin, is a strong inhibitor of placental 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11βHSD2), which is an enzyme known to block the production of glucocorticoids such as cortisol. 

As such, glycyrrhizin may increase glucocorticoid production, and research has suggested that prenatal exposure to excess glucocorticoids is associated with psychiatric illness.

To test this theory, Räikkönen and colleagues analyzed the data of 378 children, aged 13 on average, who were born in Helsinki, Finland, in 1998. 

Data on the glycyrrhizin intake of the children's mothers during pregnancy were gathered. Low intake was defined as under 249 milligrams of glycyrrhizin per week, and high intake was defined as more than 500 milligrams of glycyrrhizin - the equivalent of around 250 grams of licorice.

The team used the Child Behavior Checklist to assess the presence of psychiatric problems among the children, and neuropsychological tests were used to evaluate their cognitive function.

Compared with children born to mothers who had a low intake of glycyrrhizin during pregnancy, those born to mothers with a high intake of glycyrrhizin showed poorer performance in memory tests.

Furthermore, children of mothers who consumed large amounts of glycyrrhizin during pregnancy were more likely to have behaviors associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Additionally, the researchers found that girls started puberty earlier if their mothers consumed high amounts of glycyrrhizin while pregnant.

Although further studies are needed in order to determine the precise mechanisms by which maternal glycyrrhizin intake might impact the cognition and behavior of offspring, the team speculates that glycyrrhizin blocks 11βHSD2, leading to an increase in cortisol - the so-called stress hormone. This can cause harm to the developing fetus.

Commenting on what their findings indicate, the researchers say that:
""Licorice consumption during pregnancy may be associated with harm for the developing offspring.""
The team adds that expectant mothers should be warned about the possible harms of consuming products containing glycyrrhizin.

If mothers smoke during pregnancy, they influence the epigenetic programming of their unborn child's genetic make-up in the long term. This may give rise to an increased risk of the development of disease risks later in the child's life. Researchers at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in Leipzig, the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg and the Heidelberg University discovered that these changes are not limited to individual regions of DNA. In fact, the researchers stated in the Molecular Systems Biology journal that they particularly accumulate in enhancers of gene expression.

Maternal smoking during pregnancy is harmful to the unborn child as well as the mother. This is a known fact. ""For the first time, we can now demonstrate that exposure to tobacco smoke also causes epigenetic changes in enhancers of gene expression,"" said Irina Lehmann, Environmental Immunologist at the UFZ. These deregulated enhancers are distributed throughout the child's entire genome.

Epigenetic changes form part of countless processes that occur during human development. The genetic material functions as a blueprint for all cells. In order for different cell types, e.g. liver or muscle cells, to develop, certain genes must be activated or deactivated at certain times. One of the ways this happens is through epigenetic changes which can be disrupted by various environmental factors. In their latest study, the group of researchers from Leipzig and Heidelberg revealed that epigenetic changes related to tobacco smoke increase the risk of children developing lung diseases.

The underlying data comes from the epidemiological study entitled LiNA (Lifestyle and environmental factors and their Influence on Newborns Allergy risk). In this study, researchers asked which environmental factors could have a negative influence on children's health during pregnancy. In collaboration with the Municipal Hospital ""St. Georg"" in Leipzig, UFZ researchers have been monitoring 622 mothers and their children since 2006. The mothers underwent in-depth examinations for possible exposure to environmental factors during their pregnancy.

For their current work, two groups of mother-child pairs were examined: mothers who smoked during pregnancy and mothers who were not exposed to tobacco smoke. Together with the genome researchers working with Roland Eils at the DKFZ and the Heidelberg University, the researchers examined the epigenome of the mothers and the children. They wanted to find out whether there was evidence of epigenetic changes in the smoker families that did not occur in the non-smoker families - and which consequences this may have for the children's health. ""We were able to find evidence of epigenetic changes in smoking mothers as well as in the umbilical cord blood of the newborn babies,"" said Lehmann. The changes thus occur in the womb and affect the unborn child's gene regulation.

The researchers determined that smoking particularly affects enhancer regions in the genome. Enhancers are DNA regions that regulate the expression of one or more genes. Lehmann explained that: ""If an enhancer region is affected by the effects of smoking, this may lead to deregulation of several genes at the same time."" The researchers give an example of the consequences of a deregulated enhancer in their work: the enzyme JNK2 (c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase 2) plays a role in inflammatory responses. If the enhancer that activates JNK2 is now affected, this may increase the risk of lung diseases in the children's later life

The researchers also determined that the epigenetic effects observed in the umbilical cord blood at birth can still be seen several years after the child is born. However, it could not be ascertained beyond doubt whether these effects are long-term impacts of exposure to smoke prior to birth. ""Children who are exposed to tobacco smoke even before being born usually continue to be exposed to this after their birth,"" said Lehmann. She added that the prolonged exposure to cigarette smoke after birth may contribute to the observed stability of epigenetic changes.

In their analysis, the researchers identified more than 400 enhancers affected by tobacco smoke. They regulate genes that play a role in a variety of diseases such as diabetes, adiposity or even cancer. ""This discovery will allow us to start understanding the mechanisms that make smoking the cause of such a wide range of diseases,"" said Roland Eils.

The insights from this research are intended to provide starting points for new options for treating environmental diseases. ""The better our understanding of deregulation caused by environmental factors, the better we will be able to respond to this. Nevertheless in the case of tobacco smoke, avoiding exposure is still the best alternative,"" said Lehmann in summary.",0

Teacher burnout and student stress may be linked, according to a University of British Columbia study.

The study is the first of its kind to examine the connection between teacher burnout and students' cortisol levels, which are a biological indicator of stress.

Researchers collected saliva samples from over 400 elementary school children and tested their cortisol levels. They found that in classrooms in which teachers experienced more burnout, or feelings of emotional exhaustion, students' cortisol levels were elevated. Higher cortisol levels in elementary school children have been linked to learning difficulties as well as mental health problems.

""This suggests that stress contagion might be taking place in the classroom among students and their teachers,"" said Eva Oberle, the study's lead author and newly appointed assistant professor with the Human Early Learning Partnership (HELP) at UBC's school of population and public health. ""It is unknown what came first - elevated cortisol or teacher burnout. We consider the connection between student and teacher stress a cyclical problem in the classroom.""

Oberle said a stressful classroom climate could be a result of inadequate support for teachers, which may impact teachers' ability to effectively manage their students. A poorly managed classroom can contribute to students' needs not being met and increasing stress. This could be reflected in elevated cortisol levels in students.

Alternatively, stress could originate from students, who may be more challenging to teach because of increases in anxiety, behavioural problems, or special needs. In this scenario, teachers could feel overwhelmed and report higher levels of burnout.

""Our study is a reminder of the systemic issues facing teachers and educators as classroom sizes increase and supports for teachers are cut,"" said Oberle.

""It is clear from a number of recent research studies that teaching is one of the most stressful professions, and that teachers need adequate resources and support in their jobs in order to battle burnout and alleviate stress in the classroom,"" said UBC education professor Kimberly Schonert-Reichl, the study's co-author and director of HELP. ""If we do not support teachers, we risk the collateral damage of students.""

The study, published in Social Science & Medicine, was carried out in Grade 4 to 7 classrooms at 17 public schools in B.C.'s Lower Mainland.

Do survivors of childhood cancer return to normal health as they grow up? According to new research from Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, overall health-related quality of life in young adult survivors of childhood cancer resembles that of middle-aged adults. In a study published today in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the investigators show that childhood cancer survivors who are 18 to 29 years old report overall health-related quality of life similar to that reported by adults in the general population who are in their 40s.

The key variable determining people's sense of well-being is the presence or absence of chronic health conditions. Childhood cancer survivors have been found to have higher risks of heart disease, infertility, lung disease, cancers and other chronic conditions related largely to their prior chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. Examining health indicators in 18-to-49 year-olds who participate in the national Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), the investigators found that only 20 percent reported no chronic conditions. As survival of childhood cancer has increased substantially since the 1970s, research has expanded into ways to reduce the toxicity of treatment to minimize late effects as well as cure the disease. Although a number of pediatric cancers are now treated with less intensive therapies, aggressive treatments with high toxicities remain part of care.

""This research provides an easily accessible way to compare adult survivors of childhood cancer to the general population, in terms of their health-related quality of life, which normally declines as people age,"" said Lisa Diller, MD, chief medical officer of Dana-Farber/Boston Children's and the study's senior author. ""Our findings indicate survivors' accelerated aging and also help us understand the health-related risks associated with having had cancer as a child. What's encouraging is that the lower quality of life scores are associated with chronic disease after treatment, not with a history of pediatric cancer itself. If we can prevent treatment-related conditions by changes in the therapy we use for the cancer, then childhood cancer will become an acute, rather than a chronic, illness.""

The JNCI study is the first to use the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS) to compare the health-related quality of life of the general population with that of childhood cancer survivors. The survey's household component, which includes questions on health status and demographics, has previously been used to compare the self-reported overall health of people in the general population and those with specific conditions, such as liver disease, chronic pain or. HIV/AIDS. In addition to utilizing MEPS, the researchers included information from CCSS on siblings of childhood cancer survivors. The sibling findings matched the MEPS results.

Using health status data collected from adult CCSS respondents age 18-49, researchers assigned health-related quality of life scores in which 1 indicated perfect health and 0 indicated death. They found that childhood cancer survivors who reported no chronic health conditions had scores similar to the general population. Survivors with chronic conditions had scores that matched the scores of chronically ill members of the general population.

Findings include:

 
""By enabling comparisons to the general population, our findings provide context to better understand how the cancer experience may influence the long-term well-being of survivors,"" said Jennifer Yeh, PhD, lead author of the study and a research scientist in the Center for Health Decision Science at the Harvard Chan School. ""This is another way to understand the health challenges survivors face and where to focus efforts to improve the long-term health and quality of life of survivors.""

The MEPS sample consisted of 12,803 individuals. The CCSS sample included 7,105 survivors of pediatric cancer and 372 siblings.

Genetic variations may help explain why some men with  depression  develop  suicidal thoughts  and behaviors after they begin taking  antidepressant  medications, while most do not, according to a report in the June issue of  Archives of General Psychiatry , one of the JAMA/Archives journals.
   
Although most patients with depression respond favorably to antidepressant medications, a very small subgroup may experience worse symptoms after beginning treatment, according to background information in the article. ""Regardless of treatment specificity, nearly all antidepressant medication studies find that some patients experience suicidality [suicidal thoughts and behaviors] after treatment initiation,"" the authors write. ""Identification of this subpopulation before treatment would have tremendous clinical utility.""
   
Roy H. Perlis, M.D., of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, and colleagues studied 1,447 individuals with depression who were part of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, which was conducted from July 2001 to September 2006, and who did not express suicidal thoughts at the beginning of the study. The participants were men and women ages 18 to 75 years who had been diagnosed with non-psychotic major depressive disorder. They took the antidepressant citalopram hydrobromide for up to 12 weeks, following a protocol that advised follow-up treatment visits at two, four, six, nine and 12 weeks, with an optional visit at 14 weeks if needed. The patients' DNA was analyzed for common types of mutations nearby or within the CREB1 gene, which codes for a protein previously suggested to be involved in both antidepressant effects and suicide.
   
Of the 1,447 patients, 123 (8.5 percent) reported suicidal thoughts or behaviors during at least one follow-up visit, including 54 (10 percent) of the 539 men. Two of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) - variations that occur when a single building block of DNA is altered - were significantly and strongly associated with the onset of suicidality in men, but not in women.
   
The researchers performed additional analyses suggesting these variations are not linked to suicidal thoughts and behaviors in men before treatment. ""No statistically significant association was noted between any SNP and the presence or absence of baseline suicidality,"" the authors write. ""Likewise, no evidence of association was noted between any SNP and history of lifetime suicide attempt.""
   
Studies that link genes to illnesses are most compelling when there is additional evidence of that gene's function, the authors note. ""We recently observed an association between the same CREB1 polymorphisms and a measure of anger expression among males but not females in a sample of 94 patients with major depressive disorder; hostility and anger expression have also been associated with suicide,"" they write.
   
""If replicated, this finding would suggest that pharmacogenetic testing could facilitate the identification of the small subset of individuals at greater risk during short-term antidepressant treatment,"" the authors conclude.

Study co-author Prof. Saverio Stranges - visiting academic of the University of Warwick Medical School, United Kingdom, and scientific director of the Department of Population Health at the Luxembourg Institute of Health (LIH) - and colleagues publish their findings in the British Journal of Nutrition.

Chocolate is often perceived as a treat that should only be enjoyed from time to time. Given its high fat and sugar content, this is no surprise; overconsumption can lead to health problems, such as tooth decay and obesity.

However, studies are increasingly suggesting regular, moderate chocolate consumption may yield significant health benefits, particularly when it comes to dark chocolate.

Dark chocolate has the highest cocoa content, which means it has the highest levels of antioxidants - specifically, flavonoids - which are molecules that can prevent some forms of cell damage.

For their study, Prof. Stranges and colleagues analyzed the chocolate consumption of 1,153 people aged 18-69 who were part of the Observation of Cardiovascular Risk in Luxembourg (ORISCAV-LUX) study.

Data on chocolate intake were gathered from participants' completion of a food frequency questionnaire.

The team set out to investigate whether chocolate intake is associated with insulin resistance - where the body's cells do not effectively respond to insulin, raising the risk for type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

They also assessed how chocolate consumption affected liver enzyme levels, which is a measure of liver function.

The researchers found that 81.8 percent of the study participants consumed chocolate, with an average consumption of 24.8 grams daily.

Compared with participants who did not eat chocolate every day, those who did were found to have reduced insulin resistance and improved liver enzyme levels. The effect was stronger the higher the chocolate consumption, the team reports.

The findings remained after accounting for participants' age, sex, education, lifestyle, and dietary factors that could affect the results. 

Dietary factors included intake of tea and coffee rich in the antioxidants polyphenols, which the researchers say have the potential to spur chocolate's benefits for cardiometabolic risk.

Cardiometabolic risk refers to a person's likelihood of developing diabetes, heart disease, or stroke.

Participants who ate chocolate were more physically active, younger, and more highly educated than those who did not eat chocolate, according to the authors.

Prof. Stranges and colleagues say their findings suggest that chocolate consumption may reduce the risk of developing cardiometabolic disorders by improving liver enzyme levels and protecting against insulin resistance.
""Given the growing body of evidence, including our own study, cocoa-based products may represent an additional dietary recommendation to improve cardiometabolic health; however, observational results need to be supported by robust trial evidence.
Potential applications of this knowledge include recommendations by healthcare professionals to encourage individuals to consume a wide range of phytochemical-rich foods, which can include dark chocolate in moderate amounts.""

However, Prof. Stranges notes that it is important to distinguish the difference between chocolate that contains natural cocoa and processed chocolate; the latter is much higher in calories.

Heart failure occurs when the heart is no longer able to pump enough oxygen-rich blood around the body to support other organs.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), around 5.7 million American adults have heart failure, and in 2009, heart failure contributed to around 1 in 9 deaths in the United States.

A diet high in fat, cholesterol, and sodium is known to raise the risk of heart failure, but according to study co-author Dr. Mohamad Firas Barbour, of Brown University Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island, and colleagues, a diet high in protein may be just as harmful.

The researchers recently presented their findings at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2016, held in New Orleans, LA.

Protein is found in foods such as meat, poultry, dairy products, seafood, beans, peas, and nuts, and it is considered essential for healthy bones, muscles, and skin.

While some studies have suggested a diet high in protein may aid weight loss by suppressing appetite, other research has cited the downfalls of a high-protein diet.

A 2014 study published in the journal Cell Metabolism, for example, suggested a link between a high-protein diet and greater risk of cancer, diabetes, and all-cause mortality.

Such studies claim animal-derived proteins are more to blame for negative health implications than plant-derived proteins, and the new research is no exception.

The researchers came to their findings by analyzing data of 103,878 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years who were part of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).

As part of the survey, participants were required to complete a food frequency questionnaire that assessed their daily intake of around 125 different food items between 1993-1998. The researchers looked at subjects' total daily protein intake, as well as the total amount of daily protein consumed from meat and vegetables.

The researchers note that self-reported dietary data can be inaccurate, so they also used biomarker data to get a more reliable indication of participants' protein intake. This involved assessing subjects' urinary nitrogen and doubly labeled water levels - a measure of metabolism.

All women were free of heart failure at study baseline, and heart failure development was monitored until 2005.

A total of 1,711 of the women in the study developed heart failure, the team reports.

Compared with women who had low total protein intake, those who had a higher total protein intake were found to be at much greater risk of heart failure. The risk was greater among women who consumed most of their protein from meat.

The results remained after accounting for age, race/ethnicity, education level, high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, anemia, and arterial fibrillation.

The researchers did uncover an association between high intake of vegetable proteins and lower risk of heart failure, but when the team accounted for body mass index (BMI), this result was not statistically significant.

The team warns that the findings should be interpreted with caution and further research is required, but they do suggest a high-protein diet may be linked to heart failure.
""Higher calibrated total dietary protein intake appears to be associated with substantially increased heart failure risk while vegetable protein intake appears to be protective, although additional studies are needed to further explore this potential association.""Dr. Mohamad Firas Barbour
""Heart failure is highly prevalent, especially in postmenopausal women; therefore, a better understanding of nutrition-related factors associated with heart failure is needed,"" adds Dr. Barbour.

People who eat lots of bread are twice as likely to suffer from  kidney cancer  compared to people who eat little bread, say researchers from the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research, Milan, Italy, after looking at the dietary habits of kidney cancer patients.   

You can read about this study in the  International Journal of Cancer .   

The researchers said further studies are needed to confirm the link between bread intake  and renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer).   

The researchers looked at details on 2301 adult participants, aged 24 - 79. 767 (494 men and 273 women) of them had kidney cancer while 1,534 (988 men and 546 women) of them did not. Information was gathered on their eating and drinking habits, lifestyle,  BMI  and medical histories (personal and family).   

They found that those who consumed the most bread had a 94% higher risk of developing kidney cancer compared to those who consumed the least bread.  Bread consumption ranged from 9 to 28 portions each week.   
 What exactly does 28 portions of bread mean?   

A portion is about one to one-and-a-half slices of bread (50gms or 1.7 ounces).  So, 28 portions means between 14 to 20 sandwiches a week, depending on how thick the slices are.   
 The researchers also found:   

-- High intake of pasta and rice raises kidney cancer risk 27%  
-- High intake of milk and/or yoghurt raises kidney cancer risk by 29%  
-- High intake of poultry lowers risk by 26%  
-- High intake of processed meat lowers risk by 36%  
-- High intake of vegetables lowers risk by 35%  
-- The high intake of the following foods made no difference to risk:  coffee , tea, soups, red meat, eggs, cheese, fish, pulses, potatoes, desserts, sugars and fruits   


The researchers suggest that the blood sugar raising effects of bread could be playing a factor in increasing the kidney cancer risk.  Insulin-like growth factor levels, which play a role in  cancer  risk, may be affected if a person eats lots of bread.  Switching from a high-bread diet to a high vegetable diet could lower a person's risk, say the researchers.   
 Comment by Editor of Medical News Today   
 As the researchers, say, further research is needed.  If the high-bread consumers had eaten just high-fiber wholemeal bread, I wonder whether the findings would have been the same.  If the researchers suggest the bread is raising the blood-sugar levels, and this may be a factor in raising the risk, why didn't other starchy foods raise the risk?  Was the percentage of smokers (or people who smoked up to diagnosis) the same for the kidney cancer group as for the non-kidney cancer group?

The relationship between the birth weight of an individual and their susceptibility to diseases in adulthood, such as to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, has an important genetic component, finds a new paper published online in Nature. The study identifies 60 genomic regions associated with birth weight, most of which had not previously been identified.

Previous studies have reported association between birth weight and future risk of developing diseases; this new work demonstrates a role for genetic variation in this correlation.

Mark McCarthy and colleagues combine genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for birth weight from 153,781 individuals representing multiple ancestries - including individuals of European, African American, Chinese, Filipino, Surinamese, Turkish and Moroccan - from a total of 37 studies. First, they identify 60 genomic regions where fetal genotype is associated with birth weight. They then study these genetic associations to understand the relationship between birth weight and disease. They find an inverse genetic correlation between birth weight and risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes or coronary artery disease as an adult.

The authors caution that these results contrast with, but are not necessarily incompatible with, the idea that adverse events taking place in the womb (such as nutrient deprivation) trigger diseases later in life. They note that future studies should elucidate the relationship between events in early life and predisposition to cardiometabolic disease several decades later.

New research has shown for the first time that the part of the brain used for learning, memory and mental health is smaller in people with unhealthy diets.
 
The results of the study by researchers at Deakin University and the Australian National University (ANU) suggest that older Australians with unhealthy diets have smaller hippocampi - the hippocampus is a part of the brain believed to be integral to learning, memory and mental health. It has also shown that older people with healthier diets have larger hippocampi.
 
Associate Professor Felice Jacka, lead author of the study and researcher with Deakin University's IMPACT Strategic Research Centre in Geelong, said that as the negative impact of unhealthy foods on the waistline of the population grows, so does the evidence suggesting that our brain health is also affected.
 
""It is becoming even clearer that diet is critically important to mental as well as physical health throughout life,"" Associate Professor Jacka said.
 
""We've known for some time that components of diet, both healthy and unhealthy, have a rapid impact on aspects of the brain that affect hippocampal size and function, but up until now these studies have only been done in rats and mice. This is the first study to show that this also appears to be the case for humans.""
 
The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging to measure the size of hippocampi (there are two in the brain - left and right) in Australian adults aged 60-64 years and participating in the PATH study - a large longitudinal study of ageing conducted at the ANU. They also measured the participants' regular diets and took into account a range of other factors that could affect the hippocampus.
 
The results of the study, now published in the international journal BMC Medicine, suggest that older adults who eat more unhealthy foods, such as sweet drinks, salty snacks and processed meats, have smaller left hippocampi. It also shows that older adults who eat more nutrient-rich foods, such as vegetables, fruits and fish, have larger left hippocampi. These relationships existed over and above other factors that may explain these associations, such as gender, levels of physical activity, smoking, education or depression itself.
 
These findings have relevance for both dementia and mental health, Associate Professor Jacka said.
 
""Mental disorders account for the leading cause of disability worldwide, while rates of dementia are increasing as the population ages,"" she said.
 
""Recent research has established that diet and nutrition are related to the risk for depression, anxiety and dementia, however, until now it was not clear how diet might exert an influence on mental health and cognition.
 
""This latest study sheds light on at least one of the pathways by which eating an unhealthy diet may influence the risk for dementia, cognitive decline and mental disorders such as depression and anxiety in older people.
 
""However, it also points to the importance of diet for brain health in other age groups. As the hippocampus is critical to learning and memory throughout life, as well as being a key part of the brain involved in mental health, this study underscores the importance of good nutrition for children, adolescents and adults of all ages.""",0

People who benefit the most from getting married are people who suffered  depression  when they were single, say researchers from Ohio State Unversity, USA.  Most previous studies on marriage looked at the benefits for the whole population in general, rather than trying to find out whether certain types of people are helped more than others.    

Addrianne Frech, co-author of the study, said “Our findings question the common assumption that marriage is always a good choice for all individuals.”    

Addrianne Frech, a doctoral student in sociology and Kristi Williams, Assistant Prof. Of Sociology, Ohio State University, say this is the first study to examine the benefits of marriage for depressed and non-depressed people.    

Williams said “Those ‘average' benefits of marriage may be largely limited to people who are depressed before they entered marriage.  There may not be strong benefits for everyone.”    

They collected information from the National Survey of Families and Households.  The survey interviewed people in 1987-88 and then again in 1992-94.  Frech and Williams used data from 3,066 people who were single in 1987-88.  From 12 questions the survey had, it was possible to measure the people's level of depression.  For those who got married during the period, they examined measures of marital happiness and marital conflict.    

Frech said “We actually found the opposite of what we expected.  We thought depressed people would be less likely to benefit from marriage because the depression of one spouse can put a strain on the marriage and undermine marital quality.”    

Williams had done a previous research which indicated that levels of marital quality and conflict were key in determining depression levels in people after they got married.    

Even this study found that those who reported low prevalence of conflict were less likely to be depressed.  Hence, the surprise when they found that single depressed people seemed to benefit from marriage more than people who were not depressed when they were single.    

They did find that depressed people reported overall lower levels of marital quality after they got married when compared to non-depressed people.   Nevertheless, people who had been depressed when single benefited more psychologically from marriage than people who had not been depressed.    

They did not investigate why depressed people gain more from marriage.    

Williams said “If you start out happy, you don't have as far to go.  But also, depressed people may just be especially in need of the intimacy, the emotional closeness, and the social support that marriage can provide.  Marriage may give depressed people a greater sense that they matter to someone, while people who weren't depressed prior to marriage may have always thought that way.”    

The researchers stressed that this study only looked at people who had been married up to five years.  Whether or not the benefits are evident for depressed people over a longer period, when children appear in the scene, or the number of divorces are higher, remains to be seen.    

Frech said “We can't focus just on average effects of marriage on well-being.  As this study shows, there is a great deal of variability in the benefits of marriage.”

While controlling blood pressure, blood sugar and LDL-cholesterol levels reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes, only 7 percent of diabetic participants in three major heart studies had recommended levels of these three factors, according to research from the Heart Disease Prevention Program at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine.

The findings illustrate the need for persons with diabetes to better manage their blood pressure, blood sugar and LDL-cholesterol levels, which are prime indicators of future cardiovascular disease. The diabetic participants surveyed in the UCI review were enrolled in the three heart studies between the late '80s and early 2000s, when treatment was not as good as it is now. Still, more recent data show that only 25 percent of Americans with diabetes achieve all three of these targets.

The good news is that those in the heart studies who did control all three factors had a 62 percent lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease, according to Nathan D. Wong, lead author of the UCI report, which appears online in Diabetes Care.

""But we have done a dismal job nationally at getting most of our patients with diabetes controlled for even just these three measures,"" said Wong, director of the Heart Disease Prevention Program and a cardiology professor at UCI.

""Since cardiovascular diseases - including coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure - are leading causes of death for people with diabetes, these findings underscore the value of achieving target or lower levels of these modifiable risk factors,"" he added.

Wong and colleagues studied 2,018 adults (57 percent female) with diabetes mellitus but without known cardiovascular diseases who participated in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis or the Jackson Heart Study. Fifty-five percent were African American, 30 percent white, 11 percent Hispanic and 4 percent Asian/Pacific Islander.

The researchers compared measurements of the three key factors to American Diabetes Association guidelines that were in effect at the time - blood pressure under 130/80 mmHg, LDL (or bad) cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL and blood HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) under 7 percent. Forty-one percent of the study group were on target in one of the three categories; 27 percent had achieved two of the benchmarks; but only 7 percent met the recommended scores in all three.

Study participants' control of individual and composite factors was also examined in relation to the occurrence of new cardiovascular events (including heart attacks, coronary deaths, strokes, heart failure, percutaneous interventions and bypass surgeries) over an average follow-up of 11 years.

Wong said that proper management of any one factor translated to a 36 percent lower risk, proper management of any two factors was linked to a 52 percent lower risk, and proper management of all three factors correlated to a 62 percent lower risk of cardiovascular events compared to those without any factors controlled.

Blood pressure management appeared to benefit African Americans and women more than other ethnic groups or men; however, the converse was true for LDL control.

""Our analysis of three large U.S. cohorts including persons in whom diabetes has been diagnosed shows those who were at target levels for HbA1c, blood pressure and LDL to have substantially lower risks for cardiovascular disease than persons with diabetes who were not at target levels for such factors,"" Wong said. ""These findings emphasize the importance of composite control of these modifiable risk factors to better address the cardiovascular disease risks seen in persons with diabetes, the need for the development of healthcare strategies to better ensure such management, and the need for studies to evaluate and eliminate barriers to risk factor control in persons with diabetes.""

A brand new resource for parents combines the developmental stages of infants and young children and their relationship with food and feeding. This influence starts as early as in the womb. 

The resource has been launched by an independent group of leading experts in infant and child nutrition and development, the Infant & Toddler Forum (ITF). This is a practical guide to help parents and carers recognise and understand how growing infants and young children develop skills related to food and feeding - including taste, texture and food preferences - and how these impacts on the types of foods they are willing to eat both now and in future life.
 
The guidance also provides tips on responsive feeding - how to recognise an infant or toddlers' cues that indicate when they are hungry and when they have had enough to eat or drink. Allowing an infant or toddler to respond to natural feelings of fullness and regulating appetite may help to prevent obesity in later life.
 
This guide builds on the resource released last year for healthcare professionals, and is evidence based. The information is split into five easy to follow age group sections, giving in-depth and illustrated advice on feeding babies and young children.
 
Gillian Harris, Developmental and Clinical Psychologist and a member of the ITF comments:
""Feeding babies and young children can be an intense and emotional (positive and negative) experience for both parent and child. During the early years, a child's relationship with food and feeding, including the introduction of complementary foods and the transition to family foods, can be critical for his or her health and development, and have long term consequences on dietary range.""
 
""Parents often ask when their child will develop feeding and drinking related skills and acquire preferences for particular foods. This guidance aims to provide parents with that knowledge to help them be better informed on their child's developmental milestones. It is a great resource.""
 
The guidance is supported by other useful resources for parents, including Portion Sizes and Ten Steps for Healthy Toddlers, as well as information on common problems such food refusal and allergies.

The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, found that the greatest benefit came from consuming four or more cups of coffee a day.

""We found that coffee drinkers had a lower risk of the cancer coming back and a significantly greater survival and chance of a cure,"" says lead author Charles Fuchs, director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber.

On average, Americans drink around three cups of coffee a day, with 54% of Americans over the age of 18 consuming coffee every day. Such is the prevalence of this hot drink, it is unsurprising that a lot of research has been conducted investigating the effect that coffee has on the body.

Coffee consumption is frequently linked to a wide range of medical conditions. In the past few months, Medical News Today have reported on studies suggesting coffee consumption could raise the risk of mild cognitive impairment and reduce the risk of erectile dysfunction.

Perhaps more relevant to the current study is one published in April claiming that women diagnosed with breast cancer who are taking the drug tamoxifen could halve their risk of recurrence by drinking at least two cups a day.

According to the authors, previous observational studies have found colon cancer is more likely to recur in people with higher-than-expected levels of insulin, as well as associating increased coffee consumption with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes and increased insulin sensitivity.

However, the effect of coffee consumption on colon cancer survival and recurrence is unknown, they write.

For the prospective study, 953 patients with stage 3 colon cancer completed dietary pattern questionnaires during and 6 months after receiving chemotherapy. The researchers specifically focused on the influence of coffee, nonherbal tea and caffeine on cancer recurrence and mortality.

They found that patients who drank four or more cups of coffee a day - around 460 milligrams of caffeine - were 42% less likely to have their cancer recur than patients who did not drink coffee at all. Those who regularly drank four or more cups of coffee were also 33% less likely to die from cancer or any other cause during the follow-up period.

Further analysis of their results suggested that the lower cancer risk was attributable to the amount of caffeine consumed by the patients rather than other components of the coffee.

The precise mechanism behind these findings is currently unknown, although the researchers suggest it may be that caffeine consumption increases insulin sensitivity. This means that less insulin is required by the body, potentially reducing inflammation - a risk factor for both cancer and diabetes.

As the study is an observational one, the researchers are reticent to make recommendations about coffee consumption until their findings have been validated by further research.

""If you are a coffee drinker and are being treated for colon cancer, don't stop,"" says Fuchs. ""But if you're not a coffee drinker and wondering whether to start, you should first discuss it with your physician.""

Instead, Fuchs states that there are other measures that are proven to reduce the risk of cancer. These include avoiding obesity, following a healthy diet and regularly exercising - all of which also reduce the risk of diabetes.

Another study recently found that the risk of colon cancer could be reduced in overweight people with a regular dose of aspirin, counteracting the increased risk caused by having a high body mass index (BMI).

428,272069,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/314174.php,Too much fatty food could set children up for mental problems,Pediatrics / Children's Health,Pediatrics / Children's Health,Nutrition / Diet,Mental Health,Psychology / Psychiatry,2,3,3,1,4,3,2,3,2,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,"
Chances are that children who eat excessive amounts of fatty foods will not only become obese, but will develop cognitive and psychiatric problems when they are older. This is because, according to a recent study, diets rich in fat deplete the levels of a key protein known to help synapses in the brain to work properly. In turn, this leads to a dip in several forms of cognitive functions, such as behavioral flexibility and memory.

""These changes from a young age onwards are more the result of the fatty foods themselves, and the impact they have on young brains, rather than arising from the mere fact of being obese,"" notes Urs Meyer from ETH Zurich in Switzerland in Springer Nature's journal Molecular Psychiatry. Together with Pascale Chavis from the INMED Institute in Marseille in France, they co-directed the first study providing molecular mechanisms for how high-fat diets during adolescence negatively affect normal brain functioning and cognition.

The researchers conducted a study in mice, and observed cognitive defects as early as four weeks after the mice were fed high-fat foods. These were evident even before the animals started gaining weight and appeared specifically in mice fed high-fat foods during adolescence, and not in mice fed the same diets during adulthood.

In order to get at the mechanisms underlying such observations, the authors focused on a frontal region in the brain known as the prefrontal cortex. In humans, the prefontal cortex is associated with the planning of complex actions and decision making, expressing one's personality and controlling one's social behavior. Several human studies had shown how fat-rich diets can reduce performance on executive tasks such as problem solving and working memory, in particular in adolescents. This seems worrying in light of a marked drop in the quality of diets over the past few decades and the poor understanding of the impact these diets have on our neurons.

These effects might be particularly relevant for adolescents, according to the study authors, as adolescence is a key period of increased caloric needs and heightened appetite for young people. It is the time when they start making more choices themselves about what to eat.

Adolescents eating high-fat diets may also be prone to cognitive deficits due to the immature character of the prefrontal cortex during this time frame. ""This brain region is very interesting,"" notes French INSERM investigator Chavis, ""because, unlike the rest of the brain, it is not fully developed until early adulthood."" Researchers believe this relative immaturity makes the prefrontal cortex very sensitive to suboptimal experiences occurring during adolescence such as trauma, excessive stress or drug abuse. ""Our study highlights that the quality of the food eaten by teenagers may also be particularly important for an optimal maturation of the prefrontal cortex,"" says Marie Labouesse, lead author of the study.

""We think this adolescent vulnerability to high-fat foods might be due to the hypersensitivity of a protein known as reelin,"" notes Labouesse. The researchers saw that the prefrontal cortex of mice fed high-fat foods had fewer neurons expressing reelin and this only happened when the diets were fed during the adolescent period. The authors then zoomed in, looking at synapses, those small microscopic structures that allow neurons to communicate between each other. The reelin protein is known to regulate synaptic function, and in particular synaptic plasticity, i.e. the ability of synapses to become stronger or weaker in response to a change in brain activity.

""We saw that plasticity in the prefrontal cortex was impaired in animals fed high-fat foods during adolescence; and quite remarkably we then observed that when restoring reelin levels, both synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions went back to normal,"" notes Chavis.

""Our findings that high-fat diets during adolescence disrupt functioning of the adult prefrontal cortex suggest that a careful nutritional balance during this sensitive period is pivotal for reaching the full capacity of adult prefrontal functions,"" says Labouesse. ""Although we still need to find out the exact mechanisms by which reelin neurons get depleted during adolescence, it looks like high-fat foods could kick-start changes in how the prefrontal cortex of younger people develops.""

These findings may help explain how unhealthy foods and obesity are increasingly linked to the development of neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions.

Reelin deficiency is also a feature repeatedly documented in brain disorders such as schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. ""Although more studies on this topic are definitely needed"", warns Meyer, ""high-fat diets could potentially exacerbate the reelin and synaptic deficits in patients with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease or even aggravate cognitive anomalies.""

""Reelin is now established as being a key player in the regulation of normal brain functions. The fact that the reelin protein displays vulnerability towards the negative effects of unhealthy foods is fascinating from the scientific perspective, but also very worrying when we think of the potential impact this might have for human health,"" concludes Chavis.

Replacing carbohydrate and saturated fats with healthy fats, such as polyunsaturated fats, lowers blood sugar levels and improves insulin control, according to findings from a new meta-analysis.

Around the world, there has been a sharp increase in the rates of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that 29.1 million people have diabetes. That is approximately 9.3 percent of the population.

To treat existing diabetes, the CDC urge people to eat healthily, exercise regularly, and use medications that reduce blood glucose levels. They also emphasize the need to reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as high blood pressure and high lipid levels, and to avoid tobacco use.

CDC statistics indicate that between 2009-2012, 65 percent of people with diagnosed diabetes who were aged 18 years and above either had high levels of LDL, or ""bad,"" cholesterol in the blood, or they were using drugs to lower cholesterol.

Amid urgent calls for new ways to prevent type 2 diabetes, some research has focused on how different carbohydrates and dietary fats impact metabolic health.

This has been controversial, and it has led to confusion regarding dietary guidelines and health priorities.

Senior author Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University in Medford, MA, and first author Fumiaki Imamura, of the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, led the meta-analysis.

They looked at data for 4,660 adults that had been collected in 102 studies. In the randomized, controlled trials, the adults were given meals containing various types and quantities of carbohydrate and fat.

The researchers examined how these variations in diet impacted measures of metabolic health, and specifically, how saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and carbohydrates impact the development of type 2 diabetes.

The study focused on key biological markers of glucose and insulin control. These were blood sugar, blood insulin, insulin resistance and sensitivity, and how well the body was able to produce insulin in response to blood sugar.

Results suggested that consuming foods rich in monounsaturated fat or polyunsaturated fat had a positive effect on blood glucose control, compared with consumption of dietary carbohydrate or saturated fat.

For each 5 percent of dietary energy that was switched from carbohydrates or saturated fats to mono- or polyunsaturated fats, they found a drop of around 0.1 percent in HbA1c - a blood marker of long-term glucose control.

Previous research has suggested that for each 0.1 percent decrease in HbA1c, the incidence of type 2 diabetes drops by 22 percent and the chance of developing cardiovascular diseases falls by 6.8 percent.

Imamura notes that replacing carbohydrates and saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats appears to be consistently beneficial.

Imamura adds: ""This is a positive message for the public. Don't fear healthy fats.""
""The world faces an epidemic of insulin resistance and diabetes. Our findings support preventing and treating these diseases by eating more fat-rich foods like walnuts, sunflower seeds, soybeans, flaxseed, fish, and other vegetable oils and spreads, in place of refined grains, starches, sugars, and animal fats.""Dr. Dariush MozaffarianDr. Dariush Mozaffarian
This is the first time a team has systematically reviewed all the available evidence measuring the effects of carbohydrate and different kinds of fat in the diet.

The authors hope that the results will help scientists, healthcare workers, and the public to set priorities that will help to combat the worldwide problem of type 2 diabetes.

If you eat fatty fish, such as salmon or sardines, more than once a week, your chances of developing  kidney cancer  are 44% less than a person who does not eat fatty fish,  according to researchers at the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.   

You can read about this study in the  Journal of the American Medical Association , September 20th issue.   

The 15-year study of 61,433 women compared lean fish to fatty fish consumption, and the link to renal (kidney)  cancer .  The women answered a questionnaire about their eating habits in 1987 and then again in 1997.  They were followed up in 2004.   
 The following were classed as fatty fish:   
-- Salmon  
-- Herring  
-- Mackerel  
-- Lake trout  
-- Sardines  
-- Albacore tuna  
-- Seafood (shrimps/prawns, lobster, crayfish)   
 The following are classed as lean fish:   
Cod  
Haddock  
Hake  
Pollock  
Plaice  
Lemon sole  
Brill  
Turbot  
Black sole  
Ray  
Dogfish  
Shark   

150 women developed kidney cancer during that 15-year period (1987-2005).  Women who had consumed fatty fish at least once a week were significantly less likely to develop kidney cancer than those who never ate fatty fish, said the researchers.  Those who consumed lean fish at least once a week were no better off.   

The researchers wrote ""In this large population-based cohort with data on long-term diet, we found that women who consumed one or more servings of fatty fish per week had a statistically significant 44% decreased risk of RCC (renal cell carcinoma) compared with women who did not consume any fish. Women who reported consistent long-term consumption of fatty fish at baseline and 10 years later had a statistically significant 74 percent lower risk.""   

The researchers concluded that frequent consumption of fatty fish may lower renal cell cancer risk as a result of a higher intake of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaeneoic acid as well as  vitamin D  (all found in abundance in  fish oils ).   

Fatty fish have much higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids and  vitamin  D than lean fish, said the scientists.   

It is estimated that there will be about 208,500 cases of kidney cancer worldwide this year, and 101,900 kidney cancer deaths.  In the USA there are estimated to be 39,000 new cases this year, and 10,700 deaths  (International Agency for Research on Cancer and the American Cancer Society) .

Women with higher levels of  depression  when suffering with long-term pain report greater disability than men in the same situation, according to new research published in the latest edition of the European Journal of Pain.
   
This suggests that by targeting their depression, doctors could help reduce disability in female patients with chronic conditions such as  arthritis  and  back pain .
   
The study, which involved 260 chronic pain patients from Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases (RNHRD), builds on growing evidence that ""psychosocial"" factors can have an effect on a person's health and behavior.
   
""It is now accepted that pain is more than just a sensory experience, and that factors like a person's gender, their emotional condition or their interactions with others, can contribute to their pain experiences,"" said Dr. Ed Keogh from the Pain Management Unit at the University of Bath and RNHRD.
   
""This research shows that pain-related emotions are associated with pain-related behaviour, such as the number of visits to the GP, the number of medications taken, the amount of sleep lost, and disability, but it also highlights a significant discrepancy between the behaviours of men and women.
   
""For women in particular, targeting depression may help reduce disability associated with chronic pain.""
   
Women are already known to report higher levels of depression than men, and are generally found to report greater levels of pain, with greater frequency and greater intensity when compared to men.
   
Evidence is emerging that suggests men and women also respond differently to the drugs and other treatments, such as psychology-based interventions, used to treat pain.
   
""We found that within men with chronic pain, higher levels of depression were related to a greater of number of medications being used than women,"" said Dr. Keogh.
   
""Why this should be is not clear, but the social gender roles we adopt throughout our lives may have some important part to play.
   
""Alongside drugs, other therapies that focus on the behaviours and tendencies associated with depression, such as avoidance and withdrawal, may also be effective in these situations for some people.""

Mothers smoking in pregnancy, children skipping breakfast and not having a regular bedtime or sufficient sleep all appear to be important factors in predicting whether a child will become overweight or obese, according to new research led by UCL.

All three are early life factors which can be modified and the research highlights the possibility that prompt intervention could have an impact in curbing the growth in childhood overweight and obesity.

The paper, which was published in US journal Pediatrics, is the first research in the UK to look at the patterns of body mass index (BMI) weight development in the first 10 years of a child's life and to examine the lifestyle factors that appear to predict weight gain.

Being overweight or obese is linked to a child having poorer mental health, which can extend into adolescence and adulthood. This poorer psychosocial well-being includes low self-esteem, unhappiness as well as risky behaviours such as cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption.

The research is based on the Millennium Cohort Study, a study of children born into 19,244 families in the UK between September 2000 and January 2002. Data on weight and height was collected when the children were 3, 5, 7 and 11.

This research used observational information which does not allow firm cause and effect conclusions to be drawn. However the results are based on data from thousands of children and the researchers were able to take account of many of the influences on the development of a child's weight.

""It is well known that children of overweight or obese mothers are more likely to be overweight themselves, probably reflecting the 'obesogenic' environment and perhaps a genetic predisposition to gain weight,"" said Professor Yvonne Kelly (UCL Epidemiology and Public Health), who led the research.

""This study shows that disrupted routines, exemplified by irregular sleeping patterns and skipping breakfast, could influence weight gain through increased appetite and the consumption of energy-dense foods. These findings support the need for intervention strategies aimed at multiple spheres of influence on BMI growth.""

Smoking in pregnancy has been linked to a higher risk of a child being overweight, possibly due to a link between foetal tobacco exposure and infant motor co-ordination which could be a developmental pathway to BMI growth.

The study identified four patterns of weight development. The large majority of children, 83.3%, had a stable non-overweight BMI, while 13.1% had moderate increasing BMIs while 2.5% had steeply increasing BMIs. The smallest group, 0.6%, had BMIs in the obese range at the age of 3 but were similar to the stable group by the age of 7.

Girls were more likely to be in the ""moderately increasing"" group while Pakistani, Black Caribbean and Black African children were more likely to belong to the ""high increasing"" group.

The research also looked at other factors to see what influence, if any, they had on children's weight.

After taking account of background factors, breastfeeding and the early introduction of solid food were not associated with children's weight. Likewise, sugary drink consumption, fruit intake, TV viewing and sports participation were not strong predictors of unhealthy weight gain.

The study was supported by a grant from the Economic and Social Research Council.

New research detailing these findings was published in JAMA.

Body mass index (BMI) is used to measure body fat based on height and weight, and it is a common method of working out whether a person is overweight or obese. Obesity is a major risk factor for both type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. 

Regardless of BMI, body fat distribution can vary from one person to the next. Some people carry more fat around their visceral organs, called abdominal adiposity (fat), while others carry fat on their thighs and hips.

Previous observational studies have indicated that abdominal fat is associated with type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. However, it remains unclear whether these associations represent a causal relationship.

Dr. Sekar Kathiresan, of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and colleagues conducted a study to investigate whether being genetically inclined to have an increased waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) adjusted for BMI (a measure of abdominal fat) was linked to cardiometabolic traits (such as lipids, glucose, insulin, and systolic blood pressure), and type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease.

The team gathered data from four genome-wide association studies conducted between 2007 and 2015, which included up to 322,154 participants, and individual-level, cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank collected between 2007 and 2011, which included data from a further 111,986 people. Estimates for cardiometabolic traits were based on this combined data set.

Analysis did show that being genetically predisposed to a higher WHR adjusted for BMI was connected with increased levels of quantitative risk factors, including lipids, glucose, insulin, and systolic blood pressure, and a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease.

Kathiresan and co-authors say that the results permit several conclusions. Firstly, the findings agree with previous studies that associate abdominal fat with cardiometabolic disease. 

Secondly, the findings suggest that the distribution of body fat, beyond BMI measurement, could partly explain the disparity in risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease that is reported in both individuals and subpopulations.

""For example, increased abdominal adiposity at a given BMI has been proposed as an explanation for the excess risk of coronary heart disease observed in South Asians,"" the authors explain. ""Similarly, greater abdominal adipose tissue at a given BMI has been proposed to underlie the excess risk of coronary heart disease at a given BMI among men compared with women,"" they add.

Lastly, WHR adjusted for BMI may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for the reduction of abdominal fat and decreasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. 

""Although a substantial focus of drug development has been toward therapeutics to reduce overall adiposity, there has been little effort toward the development of therapies that modify body fat distribution to reduce abdominal adiposity,"" say the authors. Kathiresan and team conclude:

""These results provide evidence supportive of a causal association between abdominal adiposity and the development of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease.""

Limitations of the study include the fact that there is a small chance that the findings from the study represent a ""shared genetic basis"" between WHR adjusted for BMI and coronary heart disease, instead of a causal relationship.

Patients with advanced-stage  cancer  experience very poor sleep quality and often have troubling staying awake, says Emory University researcher Kathy Parker, PhD, RN.
   
Preliminary findings from the cancer sleep study were presented at the annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies (APSS) convened in Minneapolis.
   
The study provides the first comprehensive description of sleep and wake patterns of cancer patients using continuous polysomnography (PSG) data, deemed the gold standard in objective physiological measurement of sleep. It involved 114 advanced cancer patients with an average age of 51.1 years. Study patients underwent continuous sleep monitoring, or PSG, for approximately 42 hours in their home environments.
   
Results showed that study participants experienced severe difficulty with ""state maintenance,"" or the ability to maintain both the sleep and waking states. Overall they had reduced quantity and quality of nocturnal sleep and episodes of sleep scattered throughout the day. Increased amounts of daytime sleep significantly and adversely affected several key parameters of nocturnal sleep quantity and quality.
   
However, women, Caucasians, and those who were married/partnered and had more education fared better in nocturnal sleep than other study participants. In addition, relative to  breast cancer ,  lung cancer  also may be a risk factor for poor sleep.
   
""While it's unclear what definitively causes cancer patients to have trouble sleeping and staying awake, demographic factors and the type of cancer may be contributing factors,"" says Dr. Parker, Emory Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing professor, co-director of the Emory Sleep Center and study principal investigator.
   
Symptoms such as  depression , pain and  fatigue  may also play a role in the disruption of sleep among this population, Dr. Parker notes. Opioids, the mainstay of treatment for pain, may have adverse effects on sleep in cancer patients by specifically suppressing deep sleep and dream sleep and altering the normal circadian rhythms, she says.  Antidepressants , too, have been shown to cause either sleepiness or  insomnia . The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Nursing Research (NIH/NINR), is limited by the fact that contributing variables were not included in the analyses, Dr. Parker says. Additional research is needed to determine if the sleep state instability observed in this study is related to primary sleep disorders that are common in this age group such as sleep apnea and periodic limb movement disorder.

The study, recently published in the journal Immunity, found that chewing food - otherwise known as mastication - can stimulate the release of T helper 17 (Th17) cells in the mouth.

Th17 cells form a part of the adaptive immune system, which uses specific antigens to defend against potentially harmful pathogens, while enduring ""friendly"" bacteria that can be beneficial to health.

According to the study team, led by Dr. Joanne Konkel of the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom, in the gut and the skin, Th17 cells are produced through the presence of friendly bacteria.

However, the researchers note that the mechanisms by which Th17 cells are produced in the mouth have been unclear.

Dr. Konkel and colleagues note that the mechanical force required by mastication leads to physiological abrasion and damage in the mouth.

With this in mind, the team set out to investigate whether such damage might play a role in oral Th17 cell production.

The researchers came to their findings by feeding weaning mice soft-textured foods, which required less chewing, until they reached 24 weeks of age. At 24 weeks, the release of Th17 cells in the rodents' mouths was measured.

A significant reduction in oral Th17 cell production was noted, which the team speculated was down to a reduction in mastication-induced physiological damage.

Confirming their theory, the researchers found that increasing the levels of physiological damage in the rodents' mouths - by rubbing the oral cavity with a sterile cotton applicator - led to an increase in the production of Th17 cells.

Dr. Konkel and colleagues believe these findings indicate that chewing food may help to protect us from illness.
""The immune system performs a remarkable balancing act at barrier sites such as the skin, mouth and gut by fighting off harmful pathogens while tolerating the presence of normal friendly bacteria.

Our research shows that, unlike at other barriers, the mouth has a different way of stimulating Th17 cells: not by bacteria but by mastication. Therefore mastication can induce a protective immune response in our gums.""Dr. Joanne Konkel
However, the researchers caution that increased oral Th17 cell production may not always be beneficial; too many of these cells can increase the risk of periodontitis, or gum disease, which has been associated with numerous other health conditions, including diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.

In their study, the team also found that long-term exposure to physiological damage caused by mastication can exacerbate the effects of periodontitis.

They came to this finding by feeding weaning mice hardened food pellets up until 24 weeks of age. 

Compared with mice fed soft food, the mice fed hard food showed more mastication-induced physiological damage in their mouths and increased periodontal bone loss.

Still, the researchers believe that their findings could lead to new strategies to combat an array of illnesses.

""Importantly, because inflammation in the mouth is linked to development of diseases all around the body,"" says Dr. Konkel, ""understanding the tissue-specific factors that regulate immunity at the oral barrier could eventually lead to new ways to treat multiple inflammatory conditions.""

It's tempting to dip into the leftover Halloween treats, but new research out of York University has found eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, combined with regular exercise, leads to better cognitive functioning for younger and older adults, and may delay the onset of dementia. 

York U post-doctoral fellow Alina Cohen and her team, including Professors Chris I. Ardern and Joseph Baker, looked at cross-sectional data of 45,522 participants, age 30 to 80+, from the 2012 annual component of the Canadian Community Health Survey. 

What they found was that for those who are normal weight or overweight, but not obese, eating more than 10 servings of fruit and vegetable daily was linked to better cognitive functioning. When moderate exercise was added, those eating less than five servings, reported better cognitive functioning. 

Higher levels of physical activity were linked to the relationship between higher daily fruit and vegetable consumption and better cognitive performance. Those with higher body mass indexes, low activity levels and fruit and vegetable consumption were associated with poorer cognitive functioning. 

""Factors such as adhering to a healthy lifestyle including a diet that is rich in essential nutrients, regular exercise engagement, and having an adequate cardiovascular profile all seem to be effective ways by which to preserve cognitive function and delay cognitive decline,"" said Cohen. 

With rising rates of inactivity and obesity, the researchers wanted to know if there was a relationship between clusters of risk factors for cognitive decline, and how lifestyle factors might help prevent or delay it. Few studies have looked at the relationship between physical activity and eating fruit and vegetables and the effect it has on the brain for both younger and older adults. 

""It is pertinent that we develop a better understanding of the lifelong behaviours that may contribute to cognitive decline in late life by implementing a life-span approach whereby younger, middle-aged, and older adults are collectively studied, and where lifestyle risk factors are evaluated prior to a diagnosis of dementia,"" said Cohen.

The children of men with stressful jobs, particularly jobs in which they have low control over their work and low psychological demand, are at higher risk of attempting suicide than others. A study published today in the open access journal BMC Public Health also shows that boys are at higher risk of committing suicide if their father had a job with low psychological demand during the first 16 years of the child's life.    

In a study funded by the Canadian Population Health Initiative, Aleck Ostry, Clyde Hertzman, Stefania Maggi and colleagues from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, along with colleagues from other institutions in Canada and the UK studied approximately 30,000 men who were working or had worked at sawmills in British Columbia and their children. Ostry et al. collected data on the men's history of employment, their physical work conditions and their psychosocial work conditions - these include the level of responsibility, the control over their everyday tasks and their time constraints, which govern the level of  stress  they experience in their job. Ostry et al. obtained data on attempted and completed suicides among the children using a unique resource, the British Columbia Linked Health Database.    

The results of the study show that 250 of the approximately 20,000 children in the study attempted or committed suicide over the 15- year period from 1985 to 2001. Father's work conditions while their children were less than 16 years of age had an impact on attempted and completed suicides among their children. In particular, the female children of men with low control over their work may be at higher risk for attempted suicide during childhood and young adulthood than female children of fathers in jobs with more control. The sons of fathers working in jobs with low psychological demand may be at particular risk for completed suicides.    

These analyses are unusually powerful because the researchers were able to screen out the effect of father's  mental health  status on their children's risk of attempting or completing suicide.

Study co-author Vicky Lehmann, Ph.D., of Nationwide Children's Hospital and Ohio State University - both in Columbus, OH - and colleagues found that adults who received high-intensity neurotoxic treatment for cancer as a child were less likely to meet certain sexual and romantic milestones.

However, the team found that childhood cancer treatment did not affect overall satisfaction for sexual and romantic relationships in adulthood.

Lehmann and team recently reported their findings in the journal Cancer.

According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated that around 10,380 children aged 15 and under were diagnosed with cancer in the United States last year.

Leukemia is the most common form of childhood cancer, accounting for around 30 percent of all cases, followed by brain and spinal cord tumors, which make up around 26 percent of all childhood cancer cases.

While cancer was responsible for more than 1,200 childhood deaths last year, over 80 percent of children diagnosed with the disease will survive for at least 5 years. This is due to significant advances in cancer treatment, which include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

However, such treatment is certainly not without risk. For example, studies have shown that cranial radiation - often used to treat brain tumors - may cause harm to the developing brain, leading to long-term neurocognitive impairment.

Previous research has shown that neurocognitive impairment as a result of childhood cancer treatment may impact social interaction in adulthood, but studies investigating the effects of such treatment on psychosexual development are few and far between.
""Psychosexual development entails reaching certain milestones, such as sexual debut, entering committed relationships, or having children.

It is a normative part of becoming an adolescent or young adult, but only comparing such milestones without taking satisfaction into account falls short. These issues are understudied among survivors of childhood cancer.""Vicky Lehmann, Ph.D.
To address this gap in research, the team enrolled 144 survivors of childhood cancer aged between 20 and 40. A further 144 participants who were not treated for childhood cancer (the controls) were matched by age and sex.

All participants completed questionnaires on psychosexual development, sexual satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction. 

To determine the brain toxicity of cancer treatments in childhood, the researchers used data from the participants' medical charts.

Overall, the team found that adults who were treated for cancer in childhood did not differ significantly from the controls in terms of psychosexual development, sexual satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction.

However, on analyzing subgroups of childhood cancer survivors, the researchers found that those who previously received treatments high in neurotoxicity were less likely to have had sexual intercourse, be in a relationship, or have had children, compared with controls.

The type of cancer treatment in childhood did not appear to affect sexual satisfaction, the team reports. ""This highlights the subjective nature of psychosexual issues, and the importance of addressing any concerns in survivorship care,"" notes Lehmann.

The researchers say that their findings indicate that the neurotoxicity of cancer treatment in childhood may predict the likelihood of psychosexual problems in adulthood. They add:
""Additional research is needed to delineate how neurocognitive impairment undermines social outcomes for survivors, as well as other related factors. 

Given the findings of the current study, healthcare providers should assess romantic/sexual problems among survivors, especially those who received high-dose neurotoxic treatments. Referrals to psychosocial care could prevent or reduce potential difficulties.""

Based on their results, the study authors cite flu immunization during pregnancy as a ""public health priority.""

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), everyone in the United States aged 6 months or older should be vaccinated against the flu virus every year.

Flu vaccination is particularly important for children under the age of 5 years, adults aged 65 and older, and pregnant women. These groups are at the greatest risk for flu-related complications.

Now, a new study further highlights the importance of flu vaccination for expectant mothers. The study found that babies of mothers who receive the shot during pregnancy are much less likely to develop flu in the first 6 months of life.

""Babies cannot be immunized during their first 6 months, so they must rely on others for protection from the flu during that time,"" notes lead author Julie H. Shakib, assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Utah School of Medicine. 

""When pregnant women get the flu vaccine there are clear benefits for their infants.""

To reach their findings, Shakib and colleagues analyzed the health records of more than 245,000 pregnant women and their offspring - which totaled more than 249,000 infants, including twins and triplets, and even larger multiple births. The researchers looked at health records over nine flu seasons between December 2005 and March 2014.

Around 10 percent of the women reported getting the flu shot during pregnancy, while the remaining 90 percent were not vaccinated.

Over the nine flu seasons, laboratory-confirmed flu was confirmed among 658 infants aged 6 months or younger. Of these cases, 638 (97 percent) occurred among infants whose mothers had not received the flu vaccination during pregnancy.

A total of 151 of the infants with laboratory-confirmed flu were hospitalized, the researchers report, and 148 of these infants were born to mothers who had not been vaccinated against flu during pregnancy.

The researchers calculated that flu vaccination during pregnancy reduced the risk of laboratory-confirmed flu by 70 percent and the risk of flu-related hospitalization by 80 percent for infants aged 6 months and younger.

On analyzing the health records for incidence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) - a respiratory infection that is common during the winter months - the team found that flu shot during pregnancy had no impact on RSV incidence among infants.

The researchers say this finding suggests that the lower risk of flu among infants whose mothers were vaccinated during pregnancy is a result of the vaccine itself.

Senior study author Dr. Carrie L. Byington, professor of pediatrics at the University of Utah School of Medicine, notes that flu vaccination rates among expectant mothers increased during the 2009-2010 swine flu (H1N1) pandemic.

However, she says that such rates are still too low, representing a ""public health issue.""

""About 50 percent of pregnant women reported being immunized in the latest flu season,"" says Dr. Byington. ""But we need to get that number much closer to 100 percent.""

The researchers stress that both pregnant women and their offspring are at increased risk for flu-related complications, highlighting the importance of immunization.
""Pregnant women are a high-risk group during influenza season and influenza outbreaks and should receive vaccinations. If their caregivers don't offer them influenza vaccinations, I would encourage all pregnant women to ask them for it.""

Dartmouth researchers have found that children with a genetic risk for obesity had greater activity in brain reward centers when watching fast food commercials, which could help us to understand why some children are more likely to overeat. The study is the first-of-its kind to examine how a key obesity gene influences brain response to food advertisements and other cues to eat. The findings are published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

""By examining the still-developing brain and its reward-related structures, our findings help explain why children who are genetically at-risk for obesity may be prone to over-eating unhealthy foods,"" says first author, Kristina M. Rapuano, a graduate student in the Brain Imaging Lab in the department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Dartmouth College.

Television food advertisements were used for this study to better approximate how the brain responds to food cues in the real-world, as most studies to date have shown only still images of food. Seventy-eight children ages nine to 12 years old, watched a children's television show in an MRI scanner. To simulate the experience of watching television from home, the show included 12 minutes of commercial breaks - half were advertisements for fast food and the other half for non-food items. Children were also evaluated on their genetic risk for obesity based on the fat-mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene, which strongly predicts obesity across the lifespan. The nucleus accumbens, a region in the brain commonly associated with reward craving, was not only physically larger in children with the obesity-risk FTO genotype compared to genetically low-risk children but also showed a stronger craving response to the food commercials.

""About one-third of commercials children see on network television are food advertisements, and each one is a prompt to eat,"" says senior author, Diane Gilbert-Diamond, assistant professor of Epidemiology at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine and member of the Norris Cotton Cancer Center. ""We know from our prior work that children with this same genetic obesity risk factor are more likely to overeat after watching food advertisements on TV, even when they are not hungry. The brain scans suggest that these children may be especially vulnerable to food cues, and that limiting food advertisement exposure could be an effective way to combat child obesity.""

Young Coloradans diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia are more likely to live in areas of high-density oil and gas development compared to young Coloradans diagnosed with other types of cancer, according to researchers at the Colorado School of Public Health at CU Anschutz. The researchers observed no association between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and high-density oil and gas development.

""Over 378,000 Coloradans and millions of Americans currently live within a mile of at least one oil and gas well, and petroleum development continues to expand into residential areas,"" said lead investigator Dr. Lisa McKenzie, assistant research professor at the Colorado School of Public Health. ""The findings from our registry-based case control study indicate that young Coloradans diagnosed with one type of childhood leukemia are more likely to live in the densest areas of oil and gas sites. More comprehensive research that can address our study's limitations is needed to understand and explain these results.""

Funded by the CU Cancer Center and published in the journal PLOS ONE, the study shows children and young adults between the ages of 5 and 24 with acute lymphocytic leukemia were 4.3 times more likely to live in the densest area of active oil and gas wells than those with other cancers. The study focused on rural areas and towns in 57 Colorado counties and excluded urban areas of more than 50,000 people.

According to the report, US oil and gas development has grown rapidly over the past 15 years and this industrial activity has the potential to emit toxic substances into air and water, including carcinogens like benzene.

According to current research, over 15 million Americans now live within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of oil and gas development. There are hundreds of oil and gas wells within one mile of a home in Colorado's most intensive areas of oil and gas development. The study indicates that people living in areas of oil and gas development may be at an increased risk for health effects, including cancers, resultant from such industrial exposures.

The report concludes that future research should incorporate information on oil and gas development activities and production levels, as well as levels of specific pollutants of interest like benzene, near homes, schools and day care centers. It recommends such research consider specific ages and residential histories, compare cases to controls without cancer and address other potential confounders and environmental stressors.

Data for the study was obtained from the Colorado Central Cancer Registry and the Colorado Oil and Gas Information System. The study included 743 young Coloradans aged 0-24 years living in rural Colorado and diagnosed with cancer between 2001 and 2013.

Researchers used information from the Colorado Oil and Gas Information System to build a geocoded dataset with coordinates of all oil and gas wells in rural Colorado and determined dates for when each well was active.

Geocoded residential addresses of cancer patients at the time of diagnosis were linked to active well locations in the year of diagnosis and active well locations in each of the 10 years preceding the cancer diagnosis. They then took the inverse of each distance and summed the inverse distances to calculate inverse distance weighted oil and gas well counts within a 16.1 km radius of each participant's residence at cancer diagnosis for each of the 10 years prior to the date of the cancer diagnosis. The inverse distance weighted well count method gives greater weight to the wells nearer the home. Age, race, gender, income, elevation of residence and year of cancer diagnosis all were considered in the analysis.

The study was limited by the low occurrence of leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in rural Colorado, lack of specific age at cancer diagnosis and the fact that all study participants had been diagnosed with cancer. The study also was limited by the lack of information on specific activities at the well sites, place of residence before cancer diagnosis, other sources of pollution around the residence and individual characteristics such as common infections and family history of cancer.

A study by researchers at the University of Southampton and Southampton General Hospital, is the first to assess the prevalence of two different types of food hypersensitivity and the risk factors associated with them.

Food hypersensitivity is the umbrella term used to describe any condition where there is a reaction to a food. People are tested by measuring levels of a protein in the blood - immunoglobulin E (IgE) - which is linked to allergic reactions. The reactions are split into two groups, IgE-mediated, which cause a range of immediate symptoms such as skin rashes, vomiting, respiratory issues and, in some cases, potentially life-threatening reactions, and non-IgE mediated.

Non-IgE mediated reactions occur around four to 28 hours after an incident and may cause stomach complaints such as diarrhoea or constipation among other problems.

The study, published in the journal Clinical and Translational Allergy, recruited 1140 pregnant women from the UK and the children were followed up until two years of age.

Risk factors differed between IgE mediated and non-IgE mediated reactions. For IgE mediated food allergy, eczema and rhinitis increased the risk of development but for non-IgE mediated food allergy, increased risk was associated with having a pet in the house and the age at which solid food was introduced to an infant.

Dr Kate Grimshaw, senior research fellow at the University of Southampton and specialist paediatric dietitian at Southampton Children's Hospital, said: ""This study has offered us an interesting insight into what affects food allergies in children. Factors such as eczema and rhinitis are associated with food allergy, possibly due to a certain gene defect that prevents the skin barrier from forming correctly, leading to possible exposure of the immune system to allergens. Pet ownership may increase the likelihood of gut reactions to food, perhaps by altering the gut flora, which can affect how the digestive system works.

""However, we also found that a healthy diet was found to be protective for both types of reaction. This is probably because fruit and vegetables contain vitamins and other nutrients that boost the immune system.""

The study also showed that over half of the children who reacted to milk did not have an IgE mediated allergy, whereas for the vast majority of children who reacted to egg and peanut, their reaction was IgE mediated.

Dr Grimshaw said that the different reactions need to be treated differently by healthcare professionals.

She said: ""We see lots of families who want the blood test to see if their child is allergic but these tests are only useful for IgE mediated food reactions and therefore are not useful in diagnosing non IgE mediated food allergies. IgE mediated and non-IgE mediated should be considered as two separate conditions and treated accordingly. We have shown that they have distinct differences in reactions and the risks factors associated with them. Therefore it is important that health care professionals recognise that a child may be reacting to a food despite tests results being negative.""

The research, a UK based cohort called PIFA (prevalence of infant food allergy) led by Professor Graham Roberts, of the University of Southampton, and funded by the UK Food Standards Agency, was part of a wider EU study, called the EuroPrevall project, which assed more than 9,000 babies from nine European countries.

Professor Roberts and his team plan to reassess all 1,140 children who participated in PIFA at school-age to discover what happens to allergies that started in early childhood and find out which older children develop allergies and asthma.

Parents who use very overly controlling feeding practices with their children, such as using food as a reward or a treat, could be unintentionally teaching their children to rely on food to deal with their emotions. These children may be more likely to  'emotionally eat' later in childhood. These are the conclusions of a longitudinal study of parents and their children carried out by Dr Claire Farrow from Aston University and her colleagues at Loughborough and Birmingham universities. The study looked at how parents used food and the different feeding practices that they regularly used with children when they were aged three-to-five. The researchers then  followed the children up when they were aged 5-7 to explore whether earlier feeding practices influenced the development of emotional eating in the children. The researchers assessed how likely the children were to eat snack foods, or play with toys, when they were not hungry but were mildly stressed. The results showed that children were much more likely to emotionally eat at ages 5-7 if their parents had reported using more food as a reward and were overtly controlling with foods when the children were younger.

With the high levels of obesity in children, and its associated health risks being increasingly evident at a younger age, understanding why certain people turn to particular types of food at times of stress or anxiety could help in encouraging healthier eating practices.

Dr Claire Farrow, Senior Lecturer in Psychology at Aston University, comments:

""As a parent, there is often a natural instinct to try and protect our young children from eating 'bad' foods: those high in fat, sugar or salt.  Instead we often use these food types as a treat or a reward, or even as a response to ease pain if children are upset. The evidence from our initial research shows that in doing this, we may be teaching children to use these foods to cope with their different emotions, and in turn unintentionally teaching them to emotionally eat later in life.""

More research needs to be done to identify the significance of these findings on eating patterns long-term, but early indications are that the relationship children have with food is often formed early in life, and in part is informed by the ways that children are fed and taught to use food.

Dr Farrow concludes:

""Eating patterns can usually be tracked across life, so those who learn to use food as a tool to deal with emotional distress early are much more likely to follow a similar pattern of eating later on in adult life. Often when people ""emotionally eat"" they are using high calorie, high fat, energy dense foods which are not conducive to health. Learning more about how we can teach children to manage their food intake in a healthy way can help us to develop best practice advice and guidelines for families and those involved in feeding children. We know that in adults emotional eating is linked to eating disorders and obesity, so if we can learn more about the development of emotional eating in childhood, we can hopefully develop resources and advice to help prevent the development of emotional eating in children.""",0

In a new pilot study, researchers from Imperial College London in the United Kingdom reveal how phenylalanine - an amino acid produced by the digestion of protein - boosts levels of a hormone that tells us when we are full, leading to reduced food intake.

Lead author Mariana Norton will present the findings at this week's Society for Endocrinology annual meeting in the U.K.

Previous studies have shown that a diet high in protein - essential nutrients found in foods such as milk, fish, eggs, and poultry - can help reduce body weight by suppressing appetite.

According to Norton and her team, a high-protein diet can be hard to adhere to, but uncovering the mechanisms by which protein curbs hunger could lead to simpler weight-loss strategies.

For their study, the researchers conducted a series of experiments on rodents, which involved testing the effects of phenylalanine.

Phenylalanine is an amino acid produced in the gut after consumption of foods rich in protein.

Firstly, the team gave 10 mice and rats a single dose of phenylalanine and compared them with rodents that were not given the enzyme. 

The researchers found that mice and rats given phenylalanine showed increased levels of the hormone GLP-1, which suppresses appetite, but reduced levels of the hormone ghrelin, which increases hunger.

Additionally, the researchers found that phenylalanine reduced the rodents' food intake and increased weight loss. Rats that received the amino acid also moved around more, which the team notes may have contributed to their weight loss.

Next, the team administered regular doses of phenylalanine to mice with diet-induced obesity over a 7-day period.

Compared with mice that were not treated with phenylalanine, those that received the amino acid showed a reduction in weight, the researchers report.

In a final experiment, the researchers sought to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which phenylalanine affects levels of GLP-1 and ghrelin.

On applying phenylalanine to gut cells in a petri dish, the team found that the amino acid targets a receptor called the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), and it is this receptor that increases GLP-1 levels and lowers levels of ghrelin.

Obesity has become a major public health concern in the United States; around 2 in 3 adults and 1 in 6 children and adolescents are considered obese, putting them at greater risk of health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and some types of cancer.

According to Norton and her team, their findings may fuel much-needed new strategies to tackle the obesity epidemic.
""Our work is the first to demonstrate that activating CaSR can suppress appetite. It highlights the potential use of phenylalanine or other molecules which stimulate CaSR - like drugs or food components - to prevent or treat obesity.""Mariana Norton
The researchers note that further studies are needed to pinpoint the exact mechanisms by which phenylalanine can curb hunger and aid weight loss, and future research should assess whether the amino acid poses the same appetite-suppressing effects in humans as in rodents.

Your brain will never forget it,Alcohol / Addiction / Illegal Drugs,Alcohol / Addiction / Illegal Drugs,Neurology / Neuroscience,Pediatrics / Children's Health,Public Health,4,4,2,3,3,3,2,2,3,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"
Young people abuse alcohol more than any other substance in the US, and American 12-20-year olds consume 11% of all alcohol nationally.

Statistics from the National Institute of Health (NIH) show that by the age of 15 years, about 35% of teens have consumed at least one alcoholic drink, rising to around 65% by the age of 18.

Although adolescents drink less frequently than adults, the practice of binge drinking means that when they do drink, they consume more. In fact, American youths consume more than 90% of their alcohol during binge-drinking sessions.

In 2014, 8.7 million young people between the ages of 12-20 years reported drinking more than ""just a few sips"" in the previous month.

The health and safety risks of underage drinking are enormous, and the practice poses a serious public health concern.

Much of the attraction of alcohol, cocaine and other widely abused drugs lies in the perceived, euphoric ""high"" that they induce. 

Research has associated this with activation neurons in the dopamine pathways that are related to goal-oriented and reward-based behaviors, and studies have shown that dopamine receptor D1 neurons play a key role in alcohol learning and reinforcement.

To understand more about long-lasting cell changes following the first experience with alcohol consumption, researchers from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), led by Dr. Dorit Ron, looked into the neuronal behavior of mice.

They wanted to find out whether a single exposure to alcohol induces memory and behavioral changes that could promote future drinking.

The mice were subjected to a two-bottle drinking test for 24 hours, one bottle containing water and the other 20% alcohol. The next day, the scientists measured the neuron physiology for dopamine receptors D1 and D2 in the mice's brains.

In the mice that consumed alcohol, the scientists observed changes in the D1 neurons, compared with mice that only drank water. 

The results indicate that the memory registers and stores the perceived benefits of alcohol from the very first time a person drinks.

Similar changes were observed after a single dose was given to mice that had not previously consumed alcohol, indicating that a first, and perhaps even a single, experience with alcohol can bring about permanent neurological changes.

The findings help to explain the neurological changes that accompany initial alcohol exposure and suggest that similar alterations underlie the reward-based learning associated with alcohol and other substance abuse. 

The study also reveals pathways that could be targeted therapeutically by drugs to help patients who have problems with addiction.

Medical News Today recently reported that binge drinking among young people can lead to hypertension.

The findings are published in the journal EBioMedicine.

Cells throughout the body have their own internal clocks. These clocks regulate the timing of important cellular processes that are essential if the body is to function correctly. They also help to control inflammatory responses.

Inflammation is a normal reaction of the body, offering protection in times of injury or invading bacteria.

However, a high-fat diet can lead to chronic, low-grade inflammation, and this has been linked with a higher risk of disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke and rheumatoid arthritis.

Researchers from the Texas A&M Health Science Center and Texas A&M AgriLife have been looking into what makes saturated fats ""bad.""

David Earnest, PhD, who is also lead author of the current study, has previously found signs that consuming excessive amounts of fat causes the clocks in immune cells to slow down, reducing their ability to ""tell"" accurate time.

Fast facts about metabolic syndrome

Learn more about metabolic syndrome

In the present research, Earnest - a professor at the Texas A&M College of Medicine's Department of Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics - and colleagues compared the effect of palmitate, a saturated fatty acid, with DHA, a common polyunsaturated omega-3.

Pubchem - a resource of the National Institutes of Health - describes palmitic acid as: ""A saturated long-chain fatty acid with a 16-carbon backbone.""

It occurs naturally in palm oil, palm kernel oil, butter, cheese, milk and meat, and it is one of the most common long chain saturated fats in the Western diet.

While humans can easily travel through different time zones, because their whole body moves together, if some cells are shifted and others not, inflammation can occur.

Think how it would feel, says Earnest, if your wall clock, wristwatch, computer and cell phone all showed different times. How would you know which one was right?

Findings indicate that palmitate ""jet lags"" body cells, effectively setting some of them to different ""time zones,""  and causing confusion in the body, because different cell types reflect different ""clocks.""

This disruption, says Earnest, can lead to a number of health disorders, especially metabolic disease.

He explains that the likelihood of chronic inflammation depends on which saturated fats an individual consumes, and when he or she eats them.

He predicts that the best time to eat a high-fat meal is early in the morning, while the worst time is probably late at night.

The authors emphasize that not all fats are bad. In fact, certain polyunsaturated ""good"" fats and anti-inflammatory drugs can offer protection at times when saturated fats cause the most inflammation and are resetting the body clocks.

The action of DHA, for example, is anti-inflammatory. It disrupts the inflammatory response and prevents the body clocks from being set to the wrong time.

On this basis, says Earnest, omega-3 fatty acids or other anti-inflammatory treatments could be used to prevent the local time changes caused in our body clocks by saturated fats.

He says:
""We may be able to control the inflammatory response locally in specific tissues, maximizing the inflammation with timed palmitate treatment to help the body respond to infection or injury. We could then deliver appropriate treatments at specific times to block the chronic phase and potentially manage inflammation-related diseases.""

Lead investigator Sonia de Assis, Ph.D., of the Department of Oncology at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center in Washington, D.C., and colleagues present their findings in the journal Scientific Reports.

After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the United States, with around 246,660 new cases expected to be diagnosed this year.

It is well established that certain changes to genes can influence a woman's breast cancer risk, and around 5-10 percent of these gene changes are inherited.

Previous studies have shown that a woman's lifestyle factors - such as diet and smoking - may lead to gene mutations that can be passed to offspring, and some studies have indicated that maternal obesity can alter genes that could raise a child's risk for breast cancer.

But according to de Assis and colleagues, few studies have investigated how a father's weight may influence the breast cancer risk of future generations.

To address this research gap, the researchers conducted a study in which they fed male mice either a normal diet (the controls) or an obesity-inducing diet, before mating them with normal-weight female mice.

The researchers then analyzed the breast tissue and rates of breast cancer among offspring.

Compared with female pups with normal-weight fathers, those with obese fathers were overweight at birth, had delayed breast tissue development, and were more likely to develop breast cancer.

On analyzing the sperm of the obese fathers, the team found it had an altered microRNA (miRNA) signature - molecular strands that regulate gene expression. The same altered miRNA expression was found in the breast tissue of their female offspring.

Increased birth weight was also identified among male offspring of obese fathers, but the team says the finding was not statistically significant.

Overall, the authors say their findings indicate that miRNAs pass on epigenetic information from obese fathers to their daughters.
""This study provides evidence that, in animals, a father's body weight at the time of conception affects both their daughter's body weight both at birth and in childhood as well as their risk of breast cancer later in life.

Of course our study was done in mice, but it recapitulates recent findings in humans which show that obese men have significant epigenetic alterations in their sperm compared to lean men. Our animal study suggests that those epigenetic alterations in sperm may have consequences for next generation cancer risk.""Sonia de Assis, Ph.D.
The researchers say they now plan to investigate whether their findings apply to humans.

""Until we know about this association in men, we should stick to what we all know is good advice: women - and men - should eat a balanced diet, keep a healthy body weight and lifestyle, not only for their own benefit but also to give their offspring the best chances of being healthy,"" says de Assis.

It has long been assumed that  sleep deprivation  can play havoc with our emotions.
   
This is notably apparent in soldiers in combat zones, medical residents and even new parents. Now there's a neurological basis for this theory, according to new research from the University of California, Berkeley, and Harvard Medical School.
   
In the first neural investigation into what happens to the emotional brain without sleep, results from a brain imaging study suggest that while a good night's rest can regulate your mood and help you cope with the next day's emotional challenges, sleep deprivation does the opposite by excessively boosting the part of the brain most closely connected to  depression ,  anxiety  and other psychiatric disorders.
   
""It's almost as though, without sleep, the brain had reverted back to more primitive patterns of activity, in that it was unable to put emotional experiences into context and produce controlled, appropriate responses,"" said Matthew Walker, director of UC Berkeley's Sleep and Neuroimaging Laboratory and senior author of the study, which will be published Oct. 22 in the journal  Current Biology. 
   
""Emotionally, you're not on a level playing field,"" Walker added.
   
That's because the amygdala, the region of the brain that alerts the body to protect itself in times of danger, goes into overdrive on no sleep, according to the study. This consequently shuts down the prefrontal cortex, which commands logical reasoning, and thus prevents the release of chemicals needed to calm down the fight-or-flight reflex.
   
If, for example, the amygdala reacts strongly to a violent movie, the prefrontal cortex lets the brain know that the scene is make-believe and to settle down. But instead of connecting to the prefrontal cortex, the brain on no sleep connects to the locus coeruleus, the oldest part of the brain which releases noradrenalin to ward off imminent threats to survival, posing a volatile mix, according to the study.
   
The study's findings lay the groundwork for further investigation into the relationship between sleep and psychiatric illnesses. Clinical evidence has shown that some form of sleep disruption is present in almost all psychiatric disorders.
   
""This is the first set of experiments that demonstrate that even healthy people's brains mimic certain pathological psychiatric patterns when deprived of sleep,"" Walker said. ""Before, it was difficult to separate out the effect of sleep versus the disease itself. Now we're closer to being able to look into whether the person has a psychiatric disease or a sleep disorder.""
   
Using functioning Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Walker and his team found that the amygdala, which is also a key to processing emotions, became hyperactive in response to negative visual stimuli -- mutilated bodies, children with tumors and other gory images -- in study participants who stayed awake for 35 hours straight. Conversely, brain scans of those who got a full night's sleep in their own beds showed normal activity in the amygdala.
   
""The emotional centers of the brain were over 60 percent more reactive under conditions of sleep deprivation than in subjects who had obtained a normal night of sleep,"" Walker said.
   
The team studied 26 healthy participants aged 18 to 30, breaking them into two groups of equal numbers of males and females. The sleep-deprived group stayed awake during day 1, night 1 and day 2, while the sleep-control group stayed awake both days and slept normally during the night. During the fMRI brain scanning, which was performed at the end of day 2, each was shown 100 images that ranged from neutral to very negative. Using this emotional gradient, the researchers were able to compare the increase in brain response to the increasingly negative pictures.
   
Since 1998, Walker, an assistant professor of psychology at UC Berkeley and a former sleep researcher at Harvard Medical School, has been studying sleep's impact on memory, learning and brain plasticity.
   
During his research, he was struck with the consistency of how graduate students in his studies would turn from affable, rational beings into what he called ""emotional JELL-O"" after a night without sleep. He and his assistants searched for research that would explain the effect of sleep deprivation on the emotional brain and found none, although there is countless anecdotal evidence that lack of sleep causes emotional swings.
   
""You can see it in the reaction of a military combatant soldier dealing with a civilian, a tired mother to a meddlesome toddler, the medical resident to a pushy patient. It's these everyday scenarios that tell us people don't get enough sleep."" Walker said.
   
The body alternates between two different phases of sleep during the night: Rapid Eye Movement ( REM ), when body and brain activity promote dreams, and Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM), when the muscles and brain rest.
   
""All signs point to sleep doing something for emotional regulation and emotional processing,"" Walker said. ""My job now is to figure out what kind of sleep.""

People who are obese have a 25% higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders, such as  depression ,  bipolar disorder  and panic disorder, say researchers from Group Health Center for Health Studies, USA.    

The study, involving 9,000 people, also found that the link is strongest among Caucasians, people with more education and those with higher incomes - the risk here is 44% higher, when compared to people of normal weight.    

Most research on  obesity  has looked at the physical consequences, such as  heart disease ,  type 2 diabetes ,  arthritis  and  cancer .  This is the first major study to look at an association with psychiatric consequences.    

The study has been published in the  Archives of General Psychiatry , July issue.    

Asked whether depression leads to obesity or the other way round, Dr. Greg Simon, lead author, said ""It's almost certain that the association works in both directions. Understanding the connection between obesity and depression is an important public health issue because both of these conditions are so common and have a significant impact on our health care systems.""   

It was also found that obese people are 25%  less likely  to have a substance abuse disorder at some time during their lives when compared to people of normal weight.    

The average American has a 30% chance of being obese, said Dr. Simon.  A depressed person, he said, has a 40% chance of becoming obese.    

20% of US people suffer from depression at some time in their lives - the figure is 28% for obese people.    

The research team found that the incidence of depression among obese people was higher in social and cultural groups where obesity is less common.    
 Dr. Simon and team are now carrying out research into:   

-- How difficult is it for depressed people to become more physically active?    

-- Do depressed people have different diets from people who are not depressed?

Adolescents with negative body image concerns are more likely to be depressed, anxious, and suicidal than those without intense dissatisfaction over their appearance, even when compared to adolescents with other psychiatric illnesses, according to a new study by researchers at Bradley Hospital, Butler Hospital and Brown Medical School.    

Researchers assessed the prevalence and clinical correlates of body image concerns including:  body dysmorphic disorder  (BDD), eating disorders (ED) (such as  bulimia  or  anorexia ), and other clinically significant concerns over shape/weight in adolescent inpatients at Bradley Hospital, the nation's first psychiatric hospital for children and adolescents. Classic BDD is a preoccupation with an imagined physical defect in appearance or a vastly exaggerated concern about a minimal defect, like a crooked nose or imperfect complexion. Weight-related BDD, however, is classified as distressing and impairing preoccupations with one's weight and shape - ie: thinking one's thighs are too fat or one's waist is too big.    

The study found that one third of inpatient adolescents had problematic body image concerns, and that these patients were more severely ill than other adolescent inpatients in a number of important domains. Specifically, those with BDD and shape/weight preoccupations had significantly higher levels of  depression ,  anxiety , and suicidality than other patients with no body image concerns. Those with eating disorders had significantly higher rates of depression than those without body image concerns.    

""These findings underscore just how central feelings about one's appearance tend to be in the world of teenagers and how impairing these concerns can be,"" says lead author, Jennifer Dyl, PhD, with Bradley Hospital and Brown Medical School.    

This is the first study to show that adolescents with BDD and with shape/weight preoccupations display higher levels of symptoms in areas like depression, anxiety and suicidality, as compared to other adolescents presenting with psychiatric disorders such as behavioral, psychotic, or mood and anxiety disorders who do not have body image concerns.    

""This is important because distressing and impairing body image concerns appear to be very prevalent among adolescents with psychiatric illnesses, and are related to a higher degree of distress and impairment,"" says author Jennifer Kittler, PhD with Bradley Hospital and Brown Medical School.    

An additional finding revealed that in addition to higher levels of depression, anxiety and suicidality, patients with shape/weight preoccupations expressed higher levels of dissociation (a coping style characterized by blocking out emotions), sexual preoccupation/distress, and  post-traumatic stress disorder  (PTSD), suggesting that such concerns may be related to the experience of past physical or sexual abuse. 
    
  Interestingly, the authors found that the majority of the adolescents in the study were not actually overweight.    

Two hundred and eight consecutively admitted patients (ages 12 to 17) on the adolescent inpatient unit of Bradley Hospital completed the Body Dyspmorphic Disorder Questionnaire (BDDQ) as part of their admission evaluation. The questionnaire assesses the presence of BDD by asking whether respondents are very worried about how they look, think about their appearance problems a lot, and wish they could think about them less, and whether their main appearance concern is that they are not thin enough, or might become too fat. It also asks for the amount of time that they spend focusing on appearance concerns.    

""We found that 6.7 percent of patients on the adolescent inpatient unit at Bradley Hospital met criteria for classic (non-weight-related) BDD, but that a much higher percentage (22.1 percent) exhibited distressing and impairing concerns with their weight and shape,"" says Kittler.    

The study will be published in the June 2006 issue of the journal of Child Psychiatry and Human Development.    
  Body image concerns under-recognized in teens    

These findings are especially concerning for treatment providers and parents, the authors say, because the majority of adolescents in this study were not receiving psychiatric treatment specifically targeted towards their body image problems. They were most commonly being treated for mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder and these body image preoccupations may well have been contributing to the events leading to their hospitalization.    

""We have indeed seen a number of teens entering the hospital whose negative feelings about their appearance is a major influence on  suicidal thoughts  and even suicide attempts, a fact which is often initially not recognized by parents and even professionals,"" says Dyl.  

The authors looked at whether individuals determined to have BDD via a self-report measure were diagnosed with BDD by their clinician. They found that only 1 of 14 participants with definite or probable BDD was diagnosed with BDD in the clinical record.    

""This is likely due to clinicians' lack of systematic questioning about BDD, as well as patients' embarrassment and reluctance to reveal their symptoms, which may be particularly characteristic of adolescents,"" they write.    

The authors conclude that severe body image disturbances among adolescents are likely to be under-recognized and under-treated, and may be related to other forms of psychological distress (including depression and suicidality). They also note that since many adults presenting in psychiatric settings often report that preoccupation with their appearance first began in adolescence, it is all the more important to recognize and begin to treat body dysmorphic disorder and other body image concerns in the teenage years, to prevent the problem from becoming a more chronic condition.    

Even in the absence of an eating disorder, the study finds that body image concerns can be impairing, preoccupying and distressing for teens, taking up a great deal of mental energy and detracting from their quality of life.     

""Helping teens verbalize their negative feelings and concerns about their appearance is the first step in getting them to value themselves as individuals and recognize the importance of other non-weight, or non-appearance-based qualities and activities as contributors to their self-esteem and self-worth,"" Dyl explains.

Study co-author Thomas T.Y. Wang, of the United States Department of Agriculture in Beltsville, MD, and colleagues recently reported their findings in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.

Microgreens are seedlings of edible plants and herbs that can be grown indoors and harvested in just 1-2 weeks, when they are still immature.

Although they were once only served in high-end restaurants as a garnish, microgreens have grown in popularity in recent years, with more than 40 types now gracing the window boxes of homes across the United States.

Basil, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, lettuce, kale, and red cabbage are just some of the herbs and vegetables that can be grown as microgreens, but why are some people opting for these over the fully mature types?

Though small in size, studies have suggested that microgreens are big in nutrients. One study found that the tiny leaves of microgreens have up to 40 times the amount of nutrients - such as vitamins C, E, and beta-carotene - than the leaves of their mature counterparts.

Now, the new study from Wang and colleagues provides evidence that the high levels of nutrients in microgreens may translate into significant health benefits.

Previous research has suggested that mature red cabbage may reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This is often referred to as ""bad"" cholesterol, as excess levels can raise the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases.

With this in mind, Wang and team hypothesized that red cabbage microgreens may be even more beneficial for cholesterol levels, given their higher nutrient content.

To test this theory, the researchers used 60 mice that had diet-induced obesity and randomized them to one of six feeding groups for 8 weeks:

The researchers found that supplementation with either red cabbage microgreens or mature red cabbage reduced weight gain induced by a high-fat diet, and the vegetables also lowered LDL cholesterol levels in the liver.

However, the red cabbage microgreens were found to contain higher levels of polyphenols and glucosinolates - compounds that can lower cholesterol - than mature cabbage, and mice fed the tiny vegetables alongside a high-fat diet showed much lower circulating levels of LDL cholesterol.

Furthermore, red cabbage microgreens were found to reduce levels of triglycerides - a type of fat that can increase the risk of heart disease - in the liver.

Based on their results, the researchers conclude that red cabbage microgreens may be more beneficial for heart health than mature red cabbage:
""These data suggest that microgreens can modulate weight gain and cholesterol metabolism and may protect against CVD [cardiovascular disease] by preventing hypercholesterolemia.""

Body mass index (BMI) is a tool used to measure body fat and assess how it may influence the risk of associated health problems.

For adults, BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight by their height, and from this, they are given a score that places them into one of four categories: 


Obesity has become a major health problem in the United States, currently affecting more than a third of American adults and raising their risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer.

But according to study co-author Peter Nordström, Ph.D., of Umeå University in Sweden, and colleagues, a higher BMI may not necessarily raise the risk of heart attack and death.

The researchers came to their findings after analyzing 4,046 monozygotic - or identical - twin pairs, using data from the nationwide Swedish twin registry and the Screening Across Lifespan Twin (SALT) study.

The authors explain that because monozygotic twins are genetically identical, they enable the assessment of obesity-related health risks independent of genetic factors.

In all twin pairs, one twin was heavier than the other, with a higher BMI. Overall, the leaner twins  had an average BMI of 23.9, while the heavier twins had an average BMI of 25.9.

During an average 12.4 years of follow-up, the team assessed the incidence of heart attack, death, and type 2 diabetes onset among each twin pair, and looked at whether this might be associated with BMI.

For more than 3,200 of the twin pairs, the team also gathered data from questionnaires that detailed changes in BMI 30 years prior to study baseline.

Overall, the researchers found that in each twin pair, the heavier twin - even those who had a BMI of 30 or more - was at no higher risk of heart attack or death during follow-up than the leaner twin.

In detail, there were a total of 203 heart attacks (5 percent) and 550 deaths (13.6 percent) among the heavier twins, the authors report, and 209 heart attacks (5.2 percent) and 633 deaths (15.6 percent) among the leaner twins.

Additionally, the researchers found changes in BMI in the 30 years before study baseline appeared to have no influence on the later risk of heart attack or death.

When it came to onset of type 2 diabetes, however, the researchers found that the heavier twins were at greater risk than the leaner twins; a total of 345 cases of type 2 diabetes occurred among the heavier twins during follow-up, compared with 224 cases among the leaner twins.

Furthermore, they found that twins who had experienced an increase in BMI in the 30 years before study baseline were more likely to later develop type 2 diabetes, regardless of their baseline BMI.

Based on these latest findings and those of previous studies, Prof. Nordström and colleagues say the importance of obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes is ""indisputable.""

""These results suggest a causal link between obesity and the risk of diabetes, independent of genetic influence,"" they note.

However, while the authors say their study is unable to conclude that a higher BMI does not raise the risk of heart attack or death, they believe the results raise questions about the efficacy of weight loss strategies against such conditions:
""The association between obesity and diabetes was significantly stronger than the association with CVD [cardiovascular disease] and death. This finding may indicate that interventions to promote weight loss are more effective in reducing the risk of diabetes than the risk of CVD and mortality.""
The researchers point to a number of study limitations. For example, the height and weight of the twin pairs were self-reported, which may have influenced the results.

Additionally, they note that they did not gather information on subjects' waist circumference - an indicator of central obesity - which they say has been more strongly linked to CVD than BMI.

Early exposure to nicotine can trigger widespread genetic changes that affect formation of connections between brain cells long after birth, a new Yale-led study has found. The finding helps explains why maternal smoking has been linked to behavioral changes such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, addiction and conduct disorder.

Nicotine does this by affecting a master regulator of DNA packaging, which in turn influences activity of genes crucial to the formation and stabilization of synapses between brain cells, according to the study published online in the journal Nature Neuroscience.

""When this regulator is induced in mice, they pay attention to a stimulus they should ignore,'' said Marina Picciotto, the Charles B.G. Murphy Professor of Psychiatry, professor in the Child Study Center and the Departments of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, and senior author of the paper.

An inability to focus is the hallmark of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other behavioral disorders, which have been linked to maternal smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke. However, scientists did not understand how early environmental exposure to smoking could create behavioral problems years later.

Picciotto's lab found that mice exposed to nicotine during early development did indeed develop behavioral problems that mimic symptoms of attention deficit disorder in humans. They then did extensive genomic screening of mice exposed to nicotine and found higher levels of activity in a key regulator of histone methylation - a process that controls gene expression by changing the DNA wrapping around chromosomes. The researchers found that genes essential to the creation of brain synapses were heavily effected.

Furthermore, the scientists found that these genetic changes were maintained even in adult mice. However, when researchers inhibited the master regulator of histone methylation, these adult mice were calmer and no longer reacted to a stimulus they should ignore. In a final test, they triggered expression of this regulator in mice never exposed to nicotine, and the mice exhibited behavior that mimicked attention deficit disorder.

""It is exciting to find a signal that could explain the long-lasting effects of nicotine on brain cell structure and behavior,"" Picciotto said. ""It was even more intriguing to find a regulator of gene expression that responds to a stimulus like nicotine and may change synapse and brain activity during development.""

Rather than receiving  radiotherapy  or having their prostate removed, as is sometimes currently the case, many low-risk  prostate cancer  patients would be better off if their doctors kept an eye on their  cancer  until treatment became necessary, say researchers from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, USA.  You can read about this in the  Journal of the National Cancer Institute , August 16 issue.    

Past guidelines for early-stage prostate cancer was to remove the prostate.  However, as cancers are easier to detect these days, prostate cancers are being detected at ever earlier stages.  The researchers suggest that treating the prostate cancer today at a very early stage may not be in the best interests of the patient. In fact, studies have found that early aggressive treatment does nothing to improve patient survival, and could even harm his health.    

The researchers looked at data on 71,602 men, all aged over 70, who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in the period 2000-2002.  They then broke them down into those who received various therapies and those who were not treated (a ‘wait and see' approach).    

24,825 of them had lower-risk prostate cancers. Assuming waiting for treatment would have been the best approach for these cancers, the team found that 10% of these patients were overtreated with prostate removal and 44% with radiation therapy.

A diet rich in magnesium may reduce the risk of diseases including coronary heart disease, stroke and type-2 diabetes according to a new meta-analysis published in the open access journal BMC Medicine. This analysis of the evidence on dietary magnesium and health outcomes is the largest to date, involving data from more than one million people across nine countries.

The researchers, from Zhejiang University and Zhengzhou University in China, found that people in the highest category of dietary magnesium consumption had a 10% lower risk of coronary heart disease, 12% lower risk of stroke and a 26% lower risk of type-2 diabetes compared to those in the lowest category. Their results also indicate that an extra 100mg per day of dietary magnesium could also reduce risk of stroke by 7% and type-2 diabetes by 19%.

Dr Fudi Wang, lead author from the School of Public Health at Zhejiang University, said: ""Low levels of magnesium in the body have been associated with a range of diseases but no conclusive evidence has been put forward on the link between dietary magnesium and health risks. Our meta-analysis provides the most up-to-date evidence supporting a link between the role of magnesium in food and reducing the risk of disease.""

Dr Wang added: ""The current health guidelines recommend a magnesium intake of around 300mg per day for men and 270mg per day for women. Despite this, magnesium deficiency is relatively common, affecting between 2.5% and 15% of the general population. Our findings will be important for informing the public and policy makers on dietary guidelines to reduce magnesium deficiency related health risks.""

Magnesium is vital for human health and normal biological functions including glucose metabolism, protein production and synthesis of nucleic acids such as DNA. Diet is the main source of magnesium as the element can be found in foods such as spices, nuts, beans, cocoa, whole grains and green leafy vegetables.

In this analysis, data from 40 epidemiological studies covering a period from 1999 to 2016 were used to investigate associations between dietary magnesium and various diseases. In all the studies, levels of dietary magnesium were determined using a self-reported food frequency questionnaire or a 24-hour dietary recall. As the levels of magnesium used to define categories varied widely between the studies, the researchers performed a dose-response analysis for the effect of each 100mg per day increase of dietary magnesium.

This meta-analysis involves observational studies meaning that it is not possible to rule out the effect of other biological or lifestyle factors influencing the results. It is also not possible to determine if magnesium is directly responsible for reducing disease risk. However, the large size of this analysis provides robust data that were stable when adjusting for gender and study location. The authors state that their findings reinforce the notion that increased consumption of magnesium rich foods could be beneficial for overall health.

Study leader Rebecca Pearl, Ph.D. - an assistant professor of psychology at the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine - and team recently reported their findings in the journal Obesity.

Whether it is using the comment section of a celebrity news website or a post on Facebook, it seems that many people are willing to express their (often negative) opinions on someone else's weight.

Research has shown that this practice of ""body shaming"" is fueled by negative stereotyping of people who are overweight or obese - for example, that they are lazy or are to blame for their weight.

Pearl notes that there is a widespread perception that body shaming can help encourage people who are obese to improve their lifestyle and lose weight. The new study, however, shows that this is not the case - it can actually have serious consequences for health.

The research involved 159 adults aged between 21 and 65  who had a body mass index (BMI) of 33 or higher, which is classed as obese. The majority of participants were African-American, a population the researchers say is often underrepresented in weight bias studies.

All participants were a part of a larger weight loss study, in which they completed the Weight Bias Internalization Scale - a measure of the extent to which individuals apply weight stereotypes to themselves.

Subjects also completed the Patient Health Questionnaire, which the team used to determine participants' criteria for depression and metabolic syndrome.

Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of risk factors that increase the likelihood of stroke, diabetes, heart disease, and other health problems. These risk factors include high blood pressure, a large waist circumference, high fasting blood sugar, and a low level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.

A total of 51 subjects (32.1 percent) met the criteria for metabolic syndrome, the team reports.

Compared with participants who had low levels of weight bias internalization, those with high levels of internalized weight bias were found to be at a three times greater risk of metabolic syndrome.

Subjects with high weight bias internalization were also six times more likely to have high triglyceride levels, which can lead to atherosclerosis, which is a buildup of fatty substances in the wall of the arteries that can raise the risk of heart attack and stroke.

These results remained after controlling for BMI and depression.

While this study was unable to pinpoint why participants with high internalized weight bias were more likely to have metabolic syndrome, they point to previous research that suggests such bias is likely to prompt unhealthful behaviors.

""The act of self-stigmatizing may lead to a state of physiological arousal that itself increases risk for metabolic abnormalities through biological pathways (e.g., cortisol secretion). This state of physiological and affective stress may also lead individuals to cope by eating unhealthy food or binge eating,"" the authors explain.

""Additionally, individuals with high WBI [weight bias internalization] exhibit diminished self-efficacy to exercise due to endorsing negative stereotypes, such as laziness, and thus are more likely to avoid physical activity,"" they add.

Overall, the researchers believe that their findings thwart the common belief that body shaming can help to improve the lifestyle of people who are overweight or obese.
""Healthcare providers, the media, and the general public should be aware that blaming and shaming patients with obesity is not an effective tool for promoting weight loss, and it may in fact contribute to poor health if patients internalize these prejudicial messages.

Providers can play a critical role in decreasing this internalization by treating patients with respect, discussing weight with sensitivity and without judgment, and giving support and encouragement to patients who struggle with weight management - behaviors everyone should display when interacting with people with obesity.""Study co-author Tom Wadden, Ph.D., Center for Weight and Eating Disorders

Two recently published studies in the journals Age and the British Journal of Nutrition (BJN) suggest that consuming cocoa flavanols improves cardiovascular function and lessens the burden on the heart that comes with the ageing and stiffening of arteries. The studies also provide novel data to indicate that intake of cocoa flavanols reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD).

As we age, our blood vessels become less flexible and less able to expand to let blood flow and circulate normally, and the risk of hypertension also increases. Arterial stiffness and blood vessel dysfunction are linked with cardiovascular disease -- the number one cause of deaths worldwide. ""With the world population getting older, the incidence of cardiovascular disease, heart attacks and stroke will only increase,"" says Professor Malte Kelm, Professor of Cardiology, Pulmonary Diseases and Vascular Medicine at University Hospital Düsseldorf and Scientific Director of FLAVIOLA. ""It is therefore pivotal that we understand the positive impact diet can have on cardiovascular disease risk. As part of this, we want to know what role flavanol-containing foods could play in maintaining the health of the heart and blood vessels.""

Cocoa flavanols are plant-derived bioactives from the cacao bean. Dietary intake of flavanols has been shown to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular health but the compounds are often destroyed during normal food processing. Earlier studies have demonstrated that cocoa flavanol intake improves the elasticity of blood vessels and lowers blood pressure -- but, for the most part, these investigations have focused on high-risk individuals like smokers and people that have already been diagnosed with conditions like hypertension and coronary heart disease. These two studies in Age and BJN are the first to look at the different effects dietary cocoa flavanols can have on the blood vessels of healthy, low-risk individuals with no signs or symptoms of cardiovascular disease.

In the study published in Age, two groups of 22 young (pulse wave velocity), blood pressure and flow-mediated vasodilation (the extent to which blood vessels dilate in response to nitric oxide).

They found that vasodilation was significantly improved in both age groups that consumed flavanols over the course of the study (by 33% in the younger age group and 32% in the older age group over the control intervention). In the older age group, a statistically and clinically significant decrease in systolic blood pressure of 4 mmHg over control was also seen.

In the second study, published in BJN, the researchers extended their investigations to a larger group (100) of healthy middle-aged men and women (35-60 years) with low risk of CVD. The participants were randomly and blindly assigned into groups that consumed either a flavanol-containing drink or a flavanol-free control drink, twice a day for four weeks. The researchers also measured cholesterol levels in the study groups, in addition to vasodilation, arterial stiffness and blood pressure.

""We found that intake of flavanols significantly improves several of the hallmarks of cardiovascular health,"" says Professor Kelm. In particular, the researchers found that consuming flavanols for four weeks significantly increased flow-mediated vasodilation by 21%. Increased flow-mediated vasodilation is a sign of improved endothelial function and has been shown by some studies to be associated with decreased risk of developing CVD. In addition, taking flavanols decreased blood pressure (systolic by 4.4 mmHg, diastolic by 3.9 mmHg), and improved the blood cholesterol profile by decreasing total cholesterol (by 0.2 mmol/L), decreasing LDL cholesterol (by 0.17 mmol/L), and increasing HDL cholesterol (by 0.1 mmol/L).

The researchers also calculated the Framingham Risk Score - a widely used model to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular risk of an individual - and found that flavanol intake reduced the risk of CVD. ""Our results indicate that dietary flavanol intake reduces the 10-year risk of being diagnosed with CVD by 22% and the 10-year risk of suffering a heart attack by 31%,"" says Professor Kelm.

The combined results of these studies demonstrate that flavanols are effective at mitigating age-related changes in blood vessels, and could thereby reduce the risk of CVD in healthy individuals. The application of 10-year Framingham Risk Scores should be interpreted with caution as the duration of the BJN study was weeks not years and the number of participants was around 100, not reaching the scale of the Framingham studies. That being said, Professor Kelm comments that ""the reduction seen in risk scores suggests that flavanols may have primary preventive potential for CVD."" Other longer-term studies, such as the 5-year COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS) of 18,000 men and women, are now underway to investigate the health potential of flavanols on a much larger scale.

Fatty liver is shorthand for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Also shortened to NAFLD, it is called ""nonalcoholic"" to separate it from a similar liver disease caused by too much alcohol.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is seen in people whatever their level drinking, including people who do not drink any alcohol. People with the problem may be unaware of it and feel normal.

Although the fatty liver disease caused by alcohol has the same effect on the liver as NAFLD, it is considered separately. Simply known as alcoholic liver disease, it has different medical management.

Another separate condition is fatty liver of pregnancy. This condition is seen in some women who are close to full-term. Pregnancy-related fatty liver is a problem that has genetic factors.

Contents of this article:

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has a range of conditions and can develop through stages. 

Simple NAFLD is fat building up in the liver, which is called steatosis.

A threshold level is used to mean there is fatty liver but the buildup is mild enough not to cause any problems. This level is when there is fat buildup in more than 5 percent of the liver cells without any sign of further liver injury or disease.

Two other features are seen when the disease is more advanced. They may be considered complications of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease:

Exactly how and why nonalcoholic fatty liver disease develops is not clear. Obesity is a clear risk factor, however.

Other risk factors include:

Another risk factor is the metabolic syndrome, which is a clustering of the risk factors above. This means people are also more likely to get diabetes and heart disease.

Age is also a risk factor. The older people get, the more likely they are to have the above risk factors. Smoking is another risk.

About 10 to 20 percent of people get NAFLD without being obese, however.

Not everyone who is obese develops fatty liver, and not everyone who has fatty liver is obese. These exceptions are one of the reasons why the risk factors for the disease are not completely clear.


What is clear is that obesity raises the risk of fatty liver considerably.

While there are also genetic influences, one study states that ""excess fat mass remains the most common background condition,"" in NAFLD.

Fatty liver has also become the most common form of long-term liver disease in children.

A June 2016 review published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences concludes that the problem is ""affecting 10 to 20 percent of the general pediatric population, and 50 to 80 percent of those who are obese.""

""Within the next 10 years, it is expected to become the leading cause of liver pathology, liver failure, and indication for liver transplantation in childhood and adolescence in the Western world.""

Fatty liver has become more recognized, and overweight and obesity are rising problems. As a result, medical research will continue to try understanding the condition more.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease usually gives no symptoms. People with NAFLD often carry the problem without knowing it.

Most people getting the diagnosis have been tested because of risk factors. Sometimes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is discovered when testing is done for some other medical reason.

When someone with NAFLD does have symptoms, these might include:

The symptoms can be vague and similar to those of a number of other problems. This can be why diagnosis tends to be made when doctors either deliberately look for NAFLD or find it when testing for other things.

Other symptoms that might happen with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are:

The liver can get slightly bigger with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Doctors refer to this as hepatomegaly. A bigger liver may not be noticed by someone with NAFLD, but a doctor will feel for it during diagnosis.

Because NAFLD does not usually show symptoms, it tends to get diagnosed when doctors test for another condition. Routine blood tests might indicate that something wrong with the liver.

Liver enzyme levels might be high, and doctors will want to rule out some other liver disease causing this abnormality. After doing this, they may start to think about diagnosing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Diagnosis will include the doctors making sure that it cannot be possible that the problem is caused by long-term, heavy alcohol drinking.

A diagnosis can also be made after doing tests because the doctor has found that the liver is slightly bigger than normal.

An ultrasound scan may be done to look at the liver after lab tests suggest a problem. This will show fat buildup. A CAT scan done for some unrelated reason can also reveal NAFLD.

If the condition is advanced and there is liver scarring, other problems can be found. One example is a large spleen, which is another organ in the belly.

The most certain way of diagnosing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is doing a biopsy. This means removing a small amount of liver tissue. A needle inserted into the liver is used to take the sample 

After completely ruling out alcohol and other possible causes, a lab examination of the liver sample can confirm that fat has built up in the liver cells.

A biopsy is the only way to tell apart the simple cases of harmless fatty liver and the more advanced cases showing inflammation and scarring. The more advanced cases are called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and cirrhosis can develop.

Losing weight is the main step that is needed to reduce the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. A healthy diet is one of the best ways to achieve this. The best approach with diet is to:

A healthy diet and regular exercise tackle other risk factors as well as those behind nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Following this lifestyle advice will be of wider health benefit as a result.

Benefits include lowering the chances of serious diseases such as diabetes and heart attack.

The outlook for most people with fatty liver disease itself is that it does not usually cause serious problems. There is no medical treatment for NAFLD itself. Lifestyle is the only treatment option, and it can be very effective in reducing the risk of serious disease.

In a new study, researchers reveal the discovery of an inflammatory process that might drive the development of cardiovascular disease in later life. They also found that caffeine consumption could counter this inflammatory process.

Lead author David Furman, Ph.D., of the Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection at Stanford University in California, and colleagues recently reported their findings in the journal Nature Medicine.

Coffee, tea, soda, energy drinks, and chocolate are all commonly consumed foods and beverages that contain caffeine - a compound best known for its brain-stimulating abilities.

However, there is much more to caffeine than simply providing a morning energy boost. A number of studies have suggested that regular coffee intake may increase longevity. One study published in 2015, for example, found that coffee drinkers who consumed one to five cups per day had a lower risk of all-cause mortality than people who did not.

Now, Furman and colleagues say that they may have pinpointed one way by which caffeine consumption increases lifespan, and it may be down to its anti-inflammatory properties.

For their study, the researchers first set out to identify the inflammatory processes that might contribute to poor heart health in older age.

The team analyzed data from the Stanford-Ellison cohort, including one group of healthy adults aged between 20 and 30, and one group of healthy adults aged 60 and older.

Upon assessing the blood samples of each participant, the researchers identified two gene clusters that were more highly activated in the older group. They found that these gene clusters were linked to the production of IL-1-beta, a type of circulating inflammatory protein.

Next, the team assessed 23 older subjects, dividing them into two groups based on whether they had high or low activity in one or both of the gene clusters.

The researchers then analyzed the medical history of each older participant. Among the 12 subjects who had high gene cluster activity, nine had high blood pressure, compared with only one of the 11 participants who had low gene cluster activity.

Further investigation revealed that the older participants who had high gene cluster activity were also significantly more likely to have arterial stiffness - a risk factor for heart attack and stroke - compared with subjects who had low gene cluster activity.

Additionally, the researchers found that participants in the high gene cluster group who were aged 85 or older in 2008 were much more likely to have passed away by 2016.

Adults in the high gene cluster activity group also had high concentrations of IL-1-beta in their blood, as well as increased activity of free radicals - which are uncharged molecules that can cause cell damage - and a number of nucleic acid metabolites that are produced by free radical activity.

Confirming the role of the two gene clusters in inflammation and heart health, the researchers found that they were able to increase activity in one of the gene clusters by incubating an immune cell with two of the nucleic acid metabolites produced by free radical activity. This led to an increase in IL-1-beta production.

When the team injected these metabolites into mice, the rodents experienced high blood pressure and systemic inflammation. Furthermore, the renal pressure of the mice increased as a result of infiltrated immune cells, which blocked their kidneys.

However, further analysis revealed that caffeine might counter the negative effects of nucleic acid metabolites.

On assessing participants' caffeine intake, the researchers found that the blood of older adults who had low gene cluster activity was more likely to contain caffeine metabolites, such as theophylline and theobromine.

When the researchers incubated immune cells with the caffeine metabolites and the nucleic acid metabolites, they found that the caffeine metabolites prevented the inflammatory effects of the nucleic acid metabolites.

Co-senior author Mark Davis, Ph.D., also of the Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection at Stanford, says these findings demonstrate that ""an underlying inflammatory process, which is associated with aging, is not only driving cardiovascular disease but is, in turn, driven by molecular events that we may be able to target and combat.""
""That something many people drink - and actually like to drink - might have a direct benefit came as a surprise to us. We didn't give some of the mice coffee and the others decaf. 

What we've shown is a correlation between caffeine consumption and longevity. And we've shown more rigorously, in laboratory tests, a very plausible mechanism for why this might be so.""Mark Davis, Ph.D.

New research, published in the online journal BMJ Open,  describes the sugar content of fruit drinks, natural juices and smoothies, in particular, as ""unacceptably high.""

According to Yale Health, the average American consumes around 22 tsps of added sugar every day; for teens, the figure is closer to 34. One 12-oz can of soda contains 10 tsps of sugar.

The American Heart Association (AHA) recommend no more than 3-4 tsps of sugar a day for children, and 5 tsps for teens.

In the UK, guidelines recommend a maximum of 19 g, or just under 4 tsps for children aged 4-6 years, and 24 g at age 7-10 years, or just under 5 tsps, according to the UK's National Health Service (NHS).

As awareness spreads about the impact of sweetened drinks on weight gain and tooth decay, many people are turning to fruit juices and smoothies as healthy alternatives to sodas, iced tea and other favorites.

However, even 100% fruit juice is not as innocent as it seems. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend not giving juice to infants under 6 months, and children aged 1-6 should have no more than 4-6 oz, or one half to three quarters of a cup. The recommended amount for 7-18 year-olds is 8-12 oz, or 1-2 cups.

Researchers from the University of Liverpool and the University of London in the UK assessed the sugar content per 100 ml (approximately 3.5 oz) of fruit juice drinks, 100% natural juices, and smoothies aimed at children, using information from the pack label.

They checked the amount of ""free"" sugars in 203 standard portion sizes (200 ml, or around 7 oz) of UK-branded and store-brand products.

Free sugars include glucose, fructose, sucrose and table sugar, which are added by the producer, as well as naturally occurring sugars in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. Although fructose occurs naturally in fruit, when consumed as a drink, it can cause dental caries - as can any other sugar.

There are other naturally occurring sugars in whole fruits and vegetables, which the body metabolizes differently, and they act to curb energy intake. These were not included.

The sugar content in the drinks surveyed ranged from 0-16 g/100 ml, and the average was 7 g/100 ml, or around 1.5 tsps. It was significantly higher in pure fruit juices and smoothies.

The average sugar content of the 21 pure fruit juices assessed in the survey was as high as 10.7 g/100 ml or just over 2 tsps, and in the 24 smoothies, it was up to 13 g/100 ml, or just over 2.5 tsps. Over 40% of all the products, contained 19 g, or around 4 tsps, of free sugars, the maximum daily amount recommended for children.

Around 78 products contained zero-calorie sweeteners, such as aspartame. While classed as safe, health experts say they are not helping children's taste buds to get used to a less sweet diet.

Based on the findings, the team recommends:

Medical News Today asked Dr. Simon Capewell, who led the research, whether, in the light of these findings, we should reduce our fruit intake, too.

He told us:
""No. Fruit is very good for the health. Vegetables likewise. Indeed, we would recommend unlimited fruit and vegetables.""
Whole fruit has a higher fiber content than juice, it takes longer to consume, it is more satisfying, and there is evidence that the body metabolizes whole fruit in a different way, adjusting its energy intake more appropriately than it does after drinking juice.

A limitation of the study was that researchers only looked at products that are available in supermarkets, and there may be alternatives with a lower sugar content.

MNT recently reported on research suggesting that health warnings on sugary drinks could encourage parents to think twice about getting them for their children.

Study co-author Prof. Andrew Trafford, from the Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom, and colleagues publish their findings in the journal Heart.

Diabetes is estimated to affect around 29.1 million people in the United States, and approximately 1.4 million Americans are diagnosed with the condition every year.

Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for around 90-95 percent of all cases. 

In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas is either unable to produce enough insulin - the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels - or the body is unable to effectively use the insulin that is produced. As a result, blood glucose levels become too high.

High blood glucose levels can damage the nerves and blood vessels, and high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and low physical activity are common in people with diabetes - all of which are factors that contribute to heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases.

According to the American Heart Association, adults with diabetes are two to four times more likely to die from heart disease than those without diabetes, and around 68 percent of people aged 65 and older who have diabetes die from a form of heart disease.

Prof. Trafford and colleagues note that previous studies have suggested medications called PDE5 inhibitors - which include the drug Viagra (sildenafil), the first-line therapy for erectile dysfunction - may have heart health benefits for patients with diabetes.

For this latest study, the team set out to assess how PDE5 inhibitors affect the risk of heart attack incidence and mortality among men with both erectile dysfunction and type 2 diabetes.

The researchers analyzed the 2007-2015 electronic health records of 5,956 men aged 40-89 who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Of these men, 1,359 were prescribed PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction.

Overall, the team found that men who were using PDE5 inhibitors were at 31 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality during the average 6.9 years of follow-up.

Among the 1,031 men with a history of heart attack, those treated with PDE5 inhibitors had a 40 percent lower risk of death, compared with those who were not treated with the medication.

Men with history of congestive heart failure, transient ischemic attack - or ""mini heart attack"" - and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) had a 36 percent, 40 percent, and 34 percent lower risk of death, respectively, with the use of PDE5 inhibitors.

Additionally, the researchers found that men who were taking PDE5 inhibitors were at lower risk of heart attack than those who were not using the medication, with a heart attack incidence of 5.2 percent and 8.9 percent, respectively.

Among the 432 men who did have a heart attack during follow-up, the death rate stood at 25 percent for those who used PDE5 inhibitors, compared with 42.7 percent for those who did not use the drugs.

Prof. Trafford and colleagues say their findings support previous research hailing the heart health benefits of Viagra, and they call for ""urgent investigation"" into how PDE5 inhibitors might benefit patients with type 2 diabetes.

""[...] there could be considerable clinical benefit beyond the treatment of [erectile dysfunction],"" they add.

""Our laboratory work was pointing us towards the potential benefits of these erectile dysfunction treatments on the heart so it's reassuring to learn that they could reduce heart attack risk and improve heart attack survival in people with diabetes,"" says Prof. Trafford.
""Having diabetes is a major risk factor for heart disease so any treatments that could reduce that risk are urgently needed. Erectile dysfunction treatments like Viagra are already licensed for use so, if clinical trials provide further evidence of a life-saving benefit, it might be possible to start treating people with this drug in the not too distant future.""Prof. Andrew Trafford

The new statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) provides an overview of current scientific evidence suggesting that when and how often individuals eat may affect their risk factors for heart attack and stroke, as well as other cardiac and blood vessel conditions.

Research has shown that adult behavioral patterns of eating meals and snacks have changed over the past 40 years in the United States. 

For women, there has been a reduction in energy intake from meals, from 82 percent to 77 percent, and an increase in energy intake from snacks, from 18 percent to 23 percent. Similar trends have been reported in men.

The tendency to eat three standard meals per day has also declined in both men and women. People in the U.S. now have a habit of eating around the clock rather than sticking to certain meal times.

""Meal timing may affect health due to its impact on the body's internal clock,"" says Marie-Pierre St-Onge, Ph.D., writing group chair, and an associate professor of nutritional medicine at Columbia University in New York City. 

""In animal studies, it appears that when animals receive food while in an inactive phase, such as when they are sleeping, their internal clocks are reset in a way that can alter nutrient metabolism, resulting in greater weight gain, insulin resistance, and inflammation,"" St-Onge explains. ""However, more research would need to be done in humans before that can be stated as a fact,"" she adds.

Breakfast is often described as the ""most important meal of the day,"" yet research indicates that 20-30 percent of U.S. adults skip breakfast. The decline in breakfast consumption has been associated with an increase in obesity rates. Furthermore, skipping breakfast has been connected with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and chronic disease.

The AHA researchers suggest that if U.S. adults were to eat breakfast every day, the adverse effects associated with glucose and insulin metabolism would be reduced. They also suggest that comprehensive dietary advice that supports daily breakfast consumption may help people to maintain healthy dietary habits throughout the day.

Meal timing and frequency have been linked to heart disease and stroke risk factors, which include high blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose levels, as well as obesity, insulin resistance, and insulin sensitivity.

Focusing on meal timing and frequency may be a starting point for addressing the obesity epidemic. Making dietary changes that promote regular energy intake with a majority of calories consumed earlier in the day has been shown to have positive effects on risk factors for heart disease, diabetes, and body weight.

Moreover, guidelines that revolve around meal frequency and timing may help people to improve the quality of their diet without having to restrict calories to promote weight loss.

The statement notes that while the research shows that there is a relationship between meal habits and cardiovascular health, there is currently not enough evidence to show that certain eating patterns cause better and lasting benefits.

Further long-term studies of meal habits are needed before conclusions can be reached on the impact of meal frequency on heart disease and diabetes. 

""We suggest eating mindfully, by paying attention to planning both what you eat and when you eat meals and snacks, to combat emotional eating. Many people find that emotions can trigger eating episodes when they are not hungry, which often leads to eating too many calories from foods that have low nutritional value.""
Marie-Pierre St-Onge, Ph.D.
St-Onge and colleagues also say that there is a link between occasional fasting - that is, 1-2 times per week or every other day - and short-term weight loss.

""All activities have a place in a busy schedule, including healthy eating and being physically active,"" says St-Onge. ""Those activities should be planned ahead of time and adequate time should be devoted to them,"" she concludes.

Montserrat Fitó, Ph.D., was the senior author of the new research and coordinator of the Cardiovascular Risk and Nutrition Research Group at the Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain, as well as the Ciber of Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition, also in Spain. Fitó and team's findings were published in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation.

There are two types of molecules called lipoproteins that carry cholesterol in the blood: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). 

LDL is known as ""bad"" cholesterol, since having high levels of LDL can bring about plaque buildup in the arteries, which can result in heart disease and stroke. HDL is known as ""good"" cholesterol; HDL absorbs cholesterol and carries it to the liver where it is flushed from the body. Having high levels of HDL reduces heart disease and stroke.

A growing body of evidence supports the theory that the Mediterranean diet protects against the development of heart disease. Studies have also shown that the Mediterranean diet improves the lipid profile of HDLs.

""However, studies have shown that HDL doesn't work as well in people at high risk for heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular diseases and that the functional ability of HDL matters as much as its quantity,"" explains Fitó. ""At the same time, small-scale trials have shown that consuming antioxidant-rich foods like virgin olive oil, tomatoes, and berries improved HDL function in humans. We wanted to test those findings in a larger, controlled study,"" she adds.

The research team aimed to determine whether eating a Mediterranean diet enriched with virgin olive oil or nuts over a long period of time would improve the beneficial properties of HDL in humans.

Fitó and collaborators randomly selected a total of 296 individuals who had a high risk of heart disease and were participating in the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea study. The participants had an average age of 66 and were assigned to one of three diets for a year.

The first diet was a traditional Mediterranean diet enriched with around 4 tablespoons of virgin olive oil per day. The second, a traditional Mediterranean diet supplemented with a fistful of nuts each day. The third diet was a healthful ""control"" diet that contained a reduced amount of red meat, high-fat dairy products, processed foods, and sweets.

Both Mediterranean diets emphasized the inclusion of fruit, vegetables, legumes (such as beans, chickpeas, lentils, and whole grains), and moderate amounts of fish and poultry.

Blood tests were conducted at the start and end of the study to measure LDL and HDL levels.

The researchers found that total and LDL cholesterol levels were only reduced in the healthful control diet. While none of the three diets significantly increased HDL levels, the two Mediterranean diets improved HDL function, and the improvement was more pronounced in the group enriched with virgin olive oil.

The Mediterranean diet enriched with virgin olive oil improved HDL functions, such as reversing cholesterol transport, providing antioxidant protection, and enabling vasodilation.

Reverse cholesterol transport is the process in which HDL removes cholesterol from plaque in the arteries and takes it to the liver. Antioxidant protection is the ability of HDL to counteract the oxidation of LDL. Oxidation of LDL triggers the development of plaque in the arteries. 

Lastly, vasodilator capacity - which relaxes the blood vessels, keeps them open, and keeps the blood flowing - is improved by the Mediterranean diet with virgin olive oil.

Although the control diet was rich in fruits and vegetables like the two Mediterranean diets, the diet was shown to have an adverse impact on HDL's anti-inflammatory properties. This negative impact was not observed in the Mediterranean diets. A reduction in HDL's anti-inflammatory capacity is linked with a greater risk of heart disease.

As expected, the researchers only found slight differences in results between the diets, because the variation between the two Mediterranean diets was modest, and the control diet was healthful.

""Following a Mediterranean diet rich in virgin olive oil could protect our cardiovascular health in several ways, including making our 'good cholesterol' work in a more complete way.""
Montserrat Fitó
This research could contribute to the development of novel therapeutic targets, such as new antioxidant-rich foods, nutraceuticals, or new drug families that may improve HDL function, conclude the study authors.

Low-calorie sweeteners (LCSs) are often used in place of added sugars such as sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup in food and beverage products. While these artificial sweeteners offer less calories, their effects on weight management and long-term health are still under investigation. A new study in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics reports that 41% of adults and 25% of children currently consume at least one LCS item on a regular basis. The researchers note that this represents a 200% increase for children and a 54% increase among adults compared to data reported in 1999-2000.

Are LCSs good for you? ""Although LCSs were once believed to be physiologically inert, more recently their use has been suggested to influence metabolism,"" noted lead investigator Allison C. Sylvetsky, PhD, assistant professor of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. ""Some studies have suggested a beneficial effect on weight loss, while others indicate that obesity risk increases with LCS use. Little is known about the impact of long-term consumption, particularly in children. Despite the perceived benefits of replacing caloric sugars with LCSs for weight loss, evidence for the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking and some studies suggest a link between LCSs and obesity, diabetes, and other health issues.""

Using data from the 2009-2012 National Health Examination Survey (NHANES), investigators analyzed reported LCS consumption for both children and adults. Data showed that women were more likely to consume products containing LCSs and that consumption increased with body weight in adults, with people with obesity being more likely to consume LCSs than normal weight individuals. Adults with diabetes were more likely to consume LCSs compared to those without diabetes. The data also showed a relationship between LCS intake and race and income. People of non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity had higher rates of LCS consumption, as did those in higher income brackets.

Researchers noted that while parents are generally opposed to feeding their kids food or drinks containing LCSs based on prior research, they may not realize that many of the foods children bring home surprisingly contain artificial sweeteners. In addition, LCSs are now being incorporated into foods not traditionally thought of as high in sugar like yogurt, milk substitutes, breads, cereals, condiments, and drinks.

""We have previously reported that most parents have negative attitudes toward LCS consumption by their children, yet often do not recognize the presence of LCSs in foods and beverages that they purchase for their families,"" explained Dr. Sylvetsky. ""This study raised the possibility that parents may preferentially select products with nutrient content claims such as 'no sugar added' or 'light' in an effort to provide healthier options to their children, without realizing that these sugar-modified products often contain LCSs. The presence of LCSs in foods commonly consumed by children, such as canned fruit, ice cream, flavored oatmeal, and snack bars, combined with strong marketing and promotion of products deemed to be healthier alternatives, may be driving LCS food intake in children.""

The study also found that most reported LCS consumption occurs at home (71% and 72% among adults and children, respectively) and with meals (64% of adults, 62% of children). While LCSs still represented a relatively low overall proportion of total food intake, 44% of adults and 20% of children reported consuming multiple daily servings of LCSs. For 17% of LCS-consuming adults, that number was more than three times per day.

""While the effects of early life exposure to LCSs on taste preferences, weight management, and chronic disease prevention have not been well-studied in humans, compelling findings in animal models highlight the need to examine their potential health effects in humans,"" concluded Dr. Sylvetsky. ""Given that a significant proportion of children and adults in the US consume LCSs, these findings emphasize the need for prospective, long-term, well-controlled studies to determine the chronic health effects, especially in children.

A new study has found that paracetamol (acetaminophen), which is used extensively during pregnancy, has a strong association with autism spectrum symptoms in boys and for both genders in relation to attention-related and hyperactivity symptoms.

The findings were published in the International Journal of Epidemiology. This is the first study of its kind to report an independent association between the use of this drug in pregnancy and autism spectrum symptoms in children. It is also the first study to report different effects on boys and girls. Comparing persistently to nonexposed children, the study has found an increase of 30 per cent in the risk of detriment to some attention functions, and an increase of two clinical symptoms of autism spectrum symptoms in boys.

Researchers in Spain recruited 2644 mother-child pairs in a birth cohort study during pregnancy. 88 per cent were evaluated when the child was one year old, and 79.9 per cent were evaluated when they were five years old. Mothers were asked about their use of paracetamol during pregnancy and the frequency of use was classified as never, sporadic, or persistent. Exact doses could not be noted due to mothers being unable to recall them exactly.

43 per cent of children evaluated at age one and 41 per cent assessed at age five were exposed to any paracetamol at some point during the first 32 weeks of pregnancy. When assessed at age five, exposed children were at higher risk of hyperactivity or impulsivity symptoms. Persistently exposed children in particular showed poorer performance on a computerised test measuring inattention, impulsivity and visual speed processing.

Boys also showed more autism spectrum symptoms when persistently exposed to paracetamol. Lead author Claudia Avella-Garcia, researcher at CREAL, an ISGlobal allied centre in Barcelona, explained that, ""although we measured symptoms and not diagnoses, an increase in the number of symptoms that a child has, can affect him or her, even if they are not severe enough to warrant a clinical diagnosis of a neurodevelopmental disorder.""

Co-author Dr. Jordi Júlvez, also a researcher at CREAL, commented on the possible reasoning for the effects of paracetamol on neurodevelopment: ""Paracetamol could be harmful to neurodevelopment for several reasons. First of all, it relieves pain by acting on cannabinoid receptors in the brain.  Since these receptors normally help determine how neurons mature and connect with one another, paracetamol could alter these important processes.  It can also affect the development of the immune system, or be directly toxic to some fetuses that may not have the same capacity as an adult to metabolize this drug, or by creating oxidative stress.""

There could also be an explanation for why boys are more likely to have autism spectrum symptoms: ""The male brain may be more vulnerable to harmful influences during early life"", said Claudia Avella-Garcia. ""Our differing gender results suggest that androgenic endocrine disruption, to which male brains could be more sensitive, may explain the association.""

The study concluded that the widespread exposure of infants to paracetamol in utero could increase the number of children with ADHD or autism spectrum symptoms. However, they stressed further studies should be conducted with more precise dosage measurements, and that the risks versus benefits of paracetamol use during pregnancy and early life should be assessed before treatment recommendations are made.

New research indicates that reducing sodium intake may provide kidney and heart benefits for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The findings appear in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (JASN).

Urinary excretion of proteins, including albumin, is a hallmark of CKD. Therapies that reduce such albuminuria can slow kidney function decline and also have beneficial effects on the heart and blood vessels. Unfortunately, currently available therapies do not eliminate albuminuria in many patients, leaving these individuals with what is known as residual albuminuria.

A team led by Martin de Borst, MD, PhD (University Medical Center Groningen, in The Netherlands) studied 2 interventions that have demonstrated potential for reducing residual albuminuria: dietary sodium restriction and a drug (paricalcitol) that activates the vitamin D receptor. In a randomized trial that included 45 patients with CKD, each intervention was added to an optimized conventional treatment regimen during four 8-week periods.

The investigators found that dietary sodium restriction led to a significant reduction of residual albuminuria and blood pressure, whereas paricalcitol had no significant effect on these measures. The combination of paricalcitol and a low sodium diet, however, resulted in the lowest albuminuria levels.

""What we found was that sodium restriction provided a relatively large beneficial effect, whereas the effect of paricalcitol was small. Thus, the impact of the combined intervention was largely due to the protective effect of sodium restriction,"" said Dr. de Borst.

Most people consume twice as much sodium as the 2 grams per day recommended by the World Health Association. ""In our study, patients consumed on average 4 grams of sodium per day, which is well in line with global trends in sodium consumption among CKD patients,"" said Dr. de Borst. ""Interestingly, following our intervention aimed at reduced sodium intake, patients consumed 2.5 grams per day, which is still above the recommended level. This moderate restriction resulted in a strong reduction in albuminuria and blood pressure, indicating that even a moderate reduction in sodium intake may provide serious health benefits.""

The study was financially supported by the Dutch Kidney Foundation (grant nos. KJPB.08.07 and CP10.11). AbbVie provided the study medication (paricalcitol and placebo). The funding sources had no role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; and preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript.

Obesity, or a high fat diet, can lead to changes in the immune system similar to those observed with aging. That's what research published in Experimental Physiology suggests.
 
The research was carried out by scientists at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom and the Institute of Food Science, Technology and Nutrition of the Spanish National Research Council (ICTAN-CSIC), the University Complutense of Madrid and the Research Institute of the Hospital 12 de Octubre, in Spain.
 
These findings are useful as they help scientists understand the impact of obesity on our body's ability to fight infection. They also found that it was possible to reverse some of these effects by supplementing the diet with unsaturated fatty acids found in vegetable oils, such as olive or fish oils.
 
Obesity affects one in four adults in the UK and can lead to a number of serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer, and stroke1.

The researchers fed mice a high-fat diet, causing them to become obese. Signs of oxidative stress and certain properties of immune cells indicated aging of the immune system. These obese mice were then split into groups and received food supplemented either with 2-hydroxyoleic acid or omega-3 fatty acids for eight weeks.
 
Author Dr. Fatima Perez de Heredia from Liverpool John Moores University said:
 
'This is the first study, at least to our knowledge, to suggest the efficacy of 2-hydroxyoleic acid for reversing obesity-associated immune alterations and improving oxidative stress.'

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state that, among children of all ages, those under 6 months of age are at the greatest risk of being hospitalized from flu.

Because flu vaccination is only approved from the age of 6 months, it is recommended that expectant mothers receive a flu shot in order to protect themselves and their newborn children from flu-related complications.

But according to study co-author Marta C. Nunes, Ph.D., of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, and colleagues, exactly how long maternal flu vaccination protects an infant after birth has been unclear.

With a view to finding out, the team analyzed data of more than 2,000 infants born to mothers who took part in a randomized clinical trial assessing the efficacy of maternal flu vaccination.

A total of 1,026 infants were born to mothers who received the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) during pregnancy, while 1,023 infants were born to mothers who received a placebo.

As part of the trial, blood samples of the infants were taken 7 days, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 24 weeks after birth. These were assessed for the presence of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibodies - an indicator of protection against flu, with high levels signaling higher protection.

The infants were also regularly assessed for physical symptoms of flu up to the age of 6 months.

As demonstrated in previous studies, the researchers found that maternal flu vaccination offered infants some level of protection against the virus up to the age of 6 months, but they found the level of protection reduced dramatically after the first 2 months.

Maternal flu vaccination was found to be 85.6 percent effective in protecting infants against the virus in the first 8 weeks of life. However, efficacy fell to just 25.5 percent from 8-16 weeks of age, increasing slightly to 30.3 percent at 16-24 weeks of age.

What is more, among infants born to mothers who received the flu vaccine in pregnancy, the team identified a significant drop in HAI levels the first week of life, from 56 percent to just 10 percent at the age of 24 weeks.

Based on their results, the researchers say flu vaccination in pregnancy may not offer effective protection for infants after the first 8 weeks of life:
""We and others have previously demonstrated that the administration of IIV3 during pregnancy confers protection against symptomatic influenza infection to the infants of the vaccinated mothers; here we show that the duration of this protection is likely to be limited to the first 8 weeks of age.""
""Several potential mechanisms of protection have been proposed. [...] Our study suggests that the most likely mechanism of protection of the infants is through the transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies,"" they add.

The team says the results highlight the need to identify alternative strategies that protect infants against flu from 8 weeks of age.

In an editorial linked to the study, Dr. Flor Munoz, of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX, says the study from Nunes and colleagues ""contributes significantly to our understanding of infant protection against influenza through maternal vaccination,"" noting that it provides more ""conclusive information"" that the maternal flu vaccination may offer limited efficacy to young infants.

""[...] until safe and effective influenza vaccines can be given to infants younger than 6 months of age, it is imperative that passive protection is optimized,"" she adds.

470,272584,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/314693.php,Saturated fat may not increase heart disease risk after all,Nutrition / Diet,Nutrition / Diet,Cardiovascular / Cardiology,Heart Disease,Cholesterol,5,4,3,5,4,4,5,4,3,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,"
In a new Norwegian diet intervention study (FATFUNC) published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, study leader assistant Prof. Simon Nitter Dankel and colleagues have questioned and overturned the dietary theory that saturated fat is unhealthy for most of the population. This theory has dominated health literature for more than 50 years.

The notion of limiting saturated fats to support a healthy body weight and reduce the risk of chronic disease has featured in health guidelines for decades. Recently, however, scientists and health organizations have contrasting opinions on the dangers of saturated fats.

The American Heart Association (AHA) agree with government warnings and echo that the consumption of saturated fats can lead to levels of ""bad"" cholesterol in the blood that may raise the risk of heart disease. 

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, however, recommend de-emphasizing the role of saturated fat in developing heart disease, due to the lack of evidence connecting the two.

The majority of foods that are naturally rich in saturated fat come from animal sources, including meat and dairy products. The AHA recommend limiting saturated fats - such as those found in butter, cheese, red meat, and other animal-based foods - based on decades of sound science, they say.

Dankel and his team tested the risk of saturated fat on 38 men with abdominal obesity. The participants were divided into two groups and followed either a very high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet or a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet for 12 weeks. 

The researchers measured fat mass in the abdominal region, liver, and heart. They also assessed cardiovascular risk factors. 

The current theory surrounding saturated fat would suggest that the high-fat, low-carbohydrate group would be at greater risk of heart disease than the low-fat, high-carbohydrate group. However, this was not the case; there was no difference between the groups.

""The very high intake of total and saturated fat did not increase the calculated risk of cardiovascular diseases,"" says professor and cardiologist Ottar Nygård, who contributed to the study.

""Participants on the very high-fat diet also had substantial improvements in several important cardiometabolic risk factors, such as ectopic fat storage, blood pressure, blood lipids (triglycerides), insulin and blood sugar,"" he adds.

""We here looked at effects of total and saturated fat in the context of a healthy diet rich in fresh, lowly processed and nutritious foods, including high amounts of vegetables and rice instead of flour-based products,"" says Ph.D. candidate Vivian Veum. ""The fat sources were also lowly processed, mainly butter, cream, and cold-pressed oils.""

The intake of energy, proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and food types was similar across both groups, with variation mainly in quantity. The intake of added sugar was kept to a minimum.

The energy intake of both groups was mostly within normal range. Those participants that increased their energy intake still saw a reduction in fat stores and risk of disease. 

""Our findings indicate that the overriding principle of a healthy diet is not the quantity of fat or carbohydrates, but the quality of the foods we eat,"" says Ph.D. candidate Johnny Laupsa-Borge.

The FATFUNC study challenges the theory that the route to heart disease from saturated fat is paved by raising levels of ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. The study authors not only observed no significant rise in LDL cholesterol, but they also found that the high-fat diet was only associated with an increase in ""good"" cholesterol levels.

""These results indicate that most healthy people probably tolerate a high intake of saturated fat well, as long as the fat quality is good and total energy intake is not too high. It may even be healthy."" 
Ottar Nygård
""Future studies should examine which people or patients may need to limit their intake of saturated fat,"" points out Dankel, who led the study together with the director of the laboratory clinics, Prof. Gunnar Mellgren, at Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen, Norway.

""But the alleged health risks of eating good-quality fats have been greatly exaggerated. It may be more important for public health to encourage reductions in processed flour-based products, highly processed fats, and foods with added sugar,"" Dankel concludes.

Most people have heard the old adage ""an apple a day keeps the doctor away."" It's an old truth that encompasses more than just apples - eating fruit in general is well known to reduce risk for a wide variety of health conditions such as heart disease and stroke. But now a new study is showing the benefits of fruit can begin as early as in the womb.

The study, published in the journal EbioMedicine, found that mothers who consumed more fruit during pregnancy gave birth to children who performed better on developmental testing at one year of age. Piush Mandhane, senior author of the paper and associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Alberta's Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, made the discovery using data from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study - a nationwide birth cohort study involving over 3,500 Canadian infants and their families. Mandhane leads the Edmonton site of the study.

""We wanted to know if we could identify what factors affect cognitive development,"" Mandhane explains. ""We found that one of the biggest predictors of cognitive development was how much fruit moms consumed during pregnancy. The more fruit moms had, the higher their child's cognitive development.""

The study examined data from 688 Edmonton children, and controlled for factors that would normally affect a child's learning and development such as family income, paternal and maternal education, and the gestational age of the child.

Using a traditional IQ scale as a model, the average IQ is 100 and the standard deviation is 15; two thirds of the population will fall between 85 and 115. Mandhane's study showed that if pregnant mothers ate six or seven servings of fruit or fruit juice a day, on average their infants placed six or seven points higher on the scale at one year of age.

""It's quite a substantial difference - that's half of a standard deviation,"" Mandhane explains. ""We know that the longer a child is in the womb, the further they develop - and having one more serving of fruit per day in a mother's diet provides her baby with the same benefit as being born a whole week later.""

To further build on the research, Mandhane teamed with Francois Bolduc, an associate professor in the Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry's Division of Pediatric Neurology, who researches the genetic basis of cognition in humans and fruit flies. Both researchers believe that combining pre-clinical models and epidemiological analysis is a novel approach that may provide useful new insights into future medical research.

""Flies are very different from humans but, surprisingly, they have 85 per cent of the genes involved in human brain function, making them a great model to study the genetics of memory,"" says Bolduc. ""To be able to improve memory in individuals without genetic mutation is exceptional, so we were extremely interested in understanding the correlation seen between increased prenatal fruit intake and higher cognition.""

According to Bolduc, fruit flies have a long track record in the field of learning and memory. Several genes known to be necessary in fly memory have now been found to be involved in intellectual disability and autism by Bolduc and others. In a subsequent series of experiments, he showed that flies born after being fed increased prenatal fruit juice had significantly better memory ability, similar to the results shown by Mandhane with one-year-old infants. He believes it suggests that brain function affected by fruit and the mechanisms involved have been maintained through evolution, and conserved across species.

While the findings are encouraging, Mandhane cautions against going overboard on fruit consumption as potential complications such as gestational diabetes and high birthweight - conditions associated with increased intake of natural sugars - have not been fully researched. Instead, he suggests that expectant mothers meet the daily intake recommended in Canada's Food Guide and consult with their doctors.

Mandhane also says he will continue work in the field, with plans to examine if the benefits of prenatal fruit consumption persist in children over time. He will also be looking to determine if fruit can influence childhood development related to executive functioning - in areas such as planning, organizing and working memory.

A new trial from Deakin University has shown for the first time that improving diet quality can treat major depression.
 
Director of Deakin's Food and Mood Centre Professor Felice Jacka said the results of her team's new study offered a possible new treatment approach to depression, one of the world's most prevalent and costly medical disorders.
  
""We've known for some time that there is a clear association between the quality of people's diets and their risk for depression,"" Professor Jacka said.
  
""This is the case across countries, cultures and age groups, with healthy diets associated with reduced risk, and unhealthy diets associated with increased risk for depression.
  
""However, this is the first randomised controlled trial to directly test whether improving diet quality can actually treat clinical depression"".
  
In the study, adults with major depressive disorder were recruited and randomly assigned to receive either social support, which is known to be helpful for people with depression, or support from a clinical dietitian, over a three-month period.
  
The dietary group received information and assistance to improve the quality of their current diets, with a focus on increasing the consumption of vegetables, fruits, wholegrains, legumes, fish, lean red meats, olive oil and nuts, while reducing their consumption of unhealthy 'extras' foods, such as sweets, refined cereals, fried food, fast-food, processed meats and sugary drinks.
  
The results of the study, published in the international journal BMC Medicine, showed that participants in the dietary intervention group had a much greater reduction in their depressive symptoms over the three-month period, compared to those in the social support group.
  
At the end of the trial, a third of those in the dietary support group met criteria for remission of major depression, compared to 8 percent of those in the social support group. 
  
""These results were not explained by changes in physical activity or body weight, but were closely related to the extent of dietary change,"" Professor Jacka said.
  
""Those who adhered more closely to the dietary program experienced the greatest benefit to their depression symptoms.""
  
Professor Jacka, who is president of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research, said the findings offered an important new strategy for the treatment of depression.
  
""Mental disorders account for the leading cause of disability worldwide, with depression accounting for the large proportion of that burden,"" she said.
  
""While approximately half of sufferers are helped by currently available medical and psychological therapies, new treatment options for depression are urgently needed.
  
""Importantly, depression also increases the risk of and, in turn, is also increased by common physical illnesses such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Successfully improving the quality of patients' diets would also benefit these illnesses.""
  
The study suggests the new possibility of adding clinical dieticians to mental health care teams and making dietitian support available to those experiencing depression. 
  
""It also supports the previous extensive research from human population studies and animal research suggesting that diet is a key determinant of mental and brain health,"" Professor Jacka said.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2011, around 10 percent of women in the United States reported smoking in the last 3 months of pregnancy, despite the health risks it poses for mother and child.

Expectant mothers who smoke are more likely to have a miscarriage and placental problems, and babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy are at greater risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, birth defects, such as cleft lip or cleft palate, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

Increasingly, studies are suggesting that tobacco use in pregnancy may also pose risks for a child's mental health. One study published in 2013, for example, identified a link between smoking during pregnancy and increased risk of bipolar disorder in offspring.

Now, a new study from the same team - including senior author Dr. Alan Brown of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) - suggests children born to mothers who smoke while pregnant may be more likely to develop schizophrenia.

The researchers recently published their findings in the American Journal of Psychiatry.

To reach their conclusion, the researchers analyzed national registry data of all live births that occurred in Finland between 1983-1998, identifying 977 cases of schizophrenia among offspring.

These schizophrenia cases were matched by sex, date of birth, and residence to children without schizophrenia.

The mothers of the children in both groups provided blood samples in the first trimester and early second trimester of pregnancy, and these were analyzed for the presence of cotinine - a biomarker of nicotine, used to determine exposure to tobacco smoke.

The researchers found that a higher level of cotinine in the blood samples of expectant mothers was associated with a greater risk of schizophrenia among offspring.

Compared with offspring born to mothers who had low nicotine exposure during pregnancy, those born to mothers with heavy nicotine exposure during pregnancy were 38 percent more likely to develop schizophrenia, the team reports.

According to the authors, their study is the first to investigate the association between a biomarker of maternal smoking and risk of schizophrenia among offspring. They add:
""It provides the most definitive evidence to date that smoking during pregnancy is associated with schizophrenia. If replicated, these findings suggest that preventing smoking during pregnancy may decrease the incidence of schizophrenia.""
Dr. Brown says their results highlight the importance of educating the public on the potential health risks that smoking during pregnancy may have for a child's long-term health.

He notes that future research on maternal smoking should focus on identifying the biological mechanisms that underlie such health risks.

""Finally, it is of interest to examine maternal cotinine in relation to bipolar disorder, autism, and other psychiatric disorders,"" adds Dr. Brown.

Children who are left home alone, physically neglected, physically assaulted or sexually abused are more likely to smoke cigarettes or marijuana, drink alcohol, abuse inhalants and be depressed or violent when they reach adolescence, according to a study by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health.   

The study found that the most common form of maltreatment was leaving a child home alone, with two out of five respondents (41.5 percent) reporting that their parents or other adult caregivers left them home alone at least once when an adult should have been with them. The researchers hope the finding raises more concern about the link between neglectful parenting and future health.   

?Although child neglect is the most common type of maltreatment, it receives much less attention than physical or sexual abuse,? said Dr. Jon Hussey, research assistant professor of maternal and child health at the UNC School of Public Health and a fellow at the Carolina Population Center. ?However, the associations between child neglect and adolescent health risks were largely comparable to those found for child abuse.?   

The study, published in the September 2006 issue of the journal Pediatrics, examines the association between maltreatment of children and their state of health when they reach adolescence. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, researchers found that supervision neglect, physical assault, physical neglect and contact sexual abuse before the sixth grade were all associated with a number of major adolescent health risks. Each type of maltreatment was associated with eight or more of 10 adolescent health risks, including drug, cigarette and alcohol use; violence; and  depression .   

More than one in four children (28.4 percent) reported physical assault, defined as being slapped, hit or kicked by a parent or other adult caregiver. The third most prevalent type of maltreatment was physical neglect, where a parent or caregiver did not meet a child's basic needs, such as keeping him/her clean, fed and adequately clothed. Finally, by the time they entered sixth grade, about one in 25 (4.5 percent) said they had been victims of contact sexual abuse committed by a parent or other adult caregiver.   

?Because many behaviors that influence adult health are initiated and established in adolescence, understanding how childhood experiences influence these behaviors will help prevention and treatment efforts,? Hussey said. ?Children and adolescents stand a better chance of growing up to become healthy adults if we can intervene early and effectively.?

The use of tobacco and nicotine has been shown to affect the healthy development of the fetus, as well as causing premature birth or even infant death. Birth defects, sudden infant death syndrome, and low birth weight have all been associated with tobacco, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), and nicotine replacement therapy. 

Despite the well-known harmful effects of smoking, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that 10 percent of women still smoke during the final 3 months of pregnancy. 

E-cigarettes are perceived to be safer, as they do not contain tobacco and contain fewer harmful chemicals than regular cigarettes. However, the CDC warn that e-cigarettes are also harmful for the baby, as they still contain nicotine - which can affect the development of an infant's brain and lungs. 

New research - led by Ursula Koch, a professor at the Freie Universität Berlin in Germany - investigates further effects that nicotine may have on the developing fetus as well as on the newborn baby. Specifically, the research looks at the development of the auditory brainstem in mice. 

The findings were published in The Journal of Physiology.

Koch and team added nicotine to the drinking water of pregnant mice to a level equivalent to that of heavy smoking in humans. After they gave birth, their offspring continued to be exposed to nicotine through their mother's milk until they reached 3 weeks of age - roughly equivalent to the age of primary school children. 

The researchers analyzed the young mice's brain activity - namely, the signaling intensity between neurons. The team also compared these results with an age-equivalent control group of mice that had not been exposed to nicotine. 

Koch and colleagues found that in nicotine-exposed mice, neurons that normally receive sensory input from the cochlea (the sensory hearing organ) did not send signals to the other neurons in the auditory brainstem as accurately and effectively as neurons in the control mice. 

Usually, the auditory nerve carries an electrical signal to the brain, which then encodes it into sound.

In the case of nicotine-exposed mice, however, the neural signaling was less precise, which damages the coding of sound patterns. 

This is likely to cause the difficulties in auditory processing typical of children whose mothers smoked heavily during pregnancy. 

The lead author of the study comments on the findings: 
""We do not know how many other parts of the auditory system are affected by nicotine exposure. More research is needed about the cumulative effect of nicotine exposure and the molecular mechanisms of how nicotine influences the development of neurons in the auditory brainstem. If mothers smoke during pregnancy and their children show learning difficulties at school, they should be tested for auditory processing deficits.""Prof. Ursula Koch
To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that a study has shown the auditory brainstem - the area responsible for analyzing sound patterns - to develop abnormally in offspring that have been exposed to nicotine perinatally.

Hearing impairment in children due to a dysfunctional auditory brainstem tends to cause language and learning problems. This can, in turn, lead to poor expressive communication skills, poor academic achievement, and social isolation.

While half of young women aged 20-29 felt they would \""just get over\""  depression  and relied heavily on support of friends and family, the vast majority of women aged 60-69 reported taking medication and not seeking support, according to a new national survey. Overall, findings show that most women are neither aware of the age-dependent circumstances that can put them at risk for depression, nor do they adopt a comprehensive treatment approach that can increase the chances of becoming well.    

To help women of all ages better recognize and manage depression, Eli Lilly and Company and the National Women\'s Health Resource Center (NWHRC) are launching a new educational program called Ages & Stages. As part of this program, a survey(i) of more than 1,200 women with depression revealed that their views of, and experiences with, the illness varied considerably depending on their age, often leading to misunderstanding of the illness, misdiagnosis and lack of proper care.    

\""The results of the survey highlight the need for age-specific information to ensure that all women are seeking proper treatment for their depression,\"" said Dr. Vivien Burt, professor of psychiatry, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA. \""Younger women need to understand that depression is a real illness that requires treatment, while older women need to know that support is a key component of a successful treatment program. Ages & Stages covers all aspects of depression and tailors the information to the specific needs of women at different points in their lives.\""    

The Ages & Stages program, an extension of Support Partners, provides women with a comprehensive guide that leads them through different life stages and situations that could trigger depression. Special emphasis is placed on the changing role of supportive networks, as well as tips on whom women can turn to at each stage of their lives. The guide is accessible by visiting  http://www.SupportPartnersProgram.com , and clicking on the Ages & Stages icon.    

\""The Ages & Stages program sheds light on how women are affected by depression throughout their lives, and provides important information for women coping with depression,\"" said Elizabeth Battaglino Cahill, RN, executive director of the National Women\'s Health Resource Center.    

The Ages & Stages guidebook incorporates various important topics into the following chapters:    
 Young Women and Depression (20s-early 40s)    

Younger women tend to misunderstand depression and underestimate the seriousness of the illness. In fact, nearly 60 percent of women under age 29 thought that they would just \""get over\"" their depression.    

In this section of the guidebook, women will learn that, while depression can occur at any age, the first episode of major depression is most likely to happen in early adulthood. It also discusses situations when the risk for developing depression may be increased as a result of life events including a new job, failed relationship and pregnancy. Women in this age group may turn to friends and family members for support.  

The Menopause Transition (mid-40s-50s)    

The mid-40s through 50s are a time of tremendous physical change as the reproductive years come to an end. The survey revealed that some women in their 40s and 50s (12 percent) mistakenly attribute the symptoms of depression to  menopause , which may result in these women being undiagnosed and untreated.    

In this section, women will learn how to identify the symptoms of depression and the importance of working with a healthcare professional. It also focuses on other common causes of depression during this time, including \""empty nest syndrome,\"" divorce and aging parents. Additionally, the guide offers suggestions for ways women can approach someone for support, and discusses the importance of talking about their depression with their spouse or partner.    
 Older Women and Depression (60-69)    

Older women are often times forced to manage their depression alone. Less than 20 percent of women 60-69 surveyed included \""talk to family and friends\"" as a way to manage their depression. Women in this age group are also most likely to be dealing with the loss of a spouse, which can add to their solitude.    

This section of the guidebook incorporates the understanding that finding support in a woman\'s later years may be more challenging, as family members may have moved away and spouses may no longer be present. The guidebook offers insights into how these women can find the support they need and encourages them to seek help from a healthcare professional.    
 About the Support Partners Program   

Support Partners is an educational program that offers a step-by-step approach to building partnerships between people living with depression and those who want to help them. A Support Partner is someone who is committed to helping a friend or loved one with depression. He or she provides assistance as needed, builds on the strengths of the person living with depression, and encourages actions that allow recovery to happen.

 About Depression   

Up to 19 million Americans have depressive disorders, including major depression, with women twice as likely to be living with the illness. Although it is one of the most frequently seen psychiatric disorders in the primary care setting, it often goes undiagnosed or is under-treated.(ii) This may be because depressed patients often present with physical symptoms rather than emotional complaints. In one study, nearly 70 percent of patients (both men and women) diagnosed with depression reported physical symptoms as their chief reason for seeking help.(iii)    

The goal of treatment is to help people with depression feel more like themselves, so they can move forward with their lives. Depression symptoms that don\'t go away completely can prevent people with depression from getting fully well, and may increase the risk of symptoms coming back. Nobody should settle for feeling only slightly better. With the right treatment and support, recovering from depression is possible.

Preventing the development of hypertension, obesity and diabetes by the age of 45 to 55 years may lead up to an 86 percent lower risk for heart failure through the remainder of life, according to research published in JACC: Heart Failure.

Approximately 5.7 million adults in the United States currently suffer from hearth failure. This population faces a significantly reduced quality of life and higher mortality rates. Hypertension, obesity and diabetes are highly prevalent and preventable risk factors for heart failure.

""As the incidence of heart failure is increasing, it is important that we accelerate the research effort on the prevention of heart failure,"" said Christopher O'Connor, M.D., FACC, Editor-in-Chief of JACC: Heart Failure.

Researchers conducted a pooled, individual-level analysis sampling from communities across the United States. They found that at ages 45 and 55 years, respectively, 53.2 percent and 43.7 percent of participants were free of hypertension, obesity and diabetes. After the index age of 45 years, during 516,537 person-years of follow-up, 1,677 cases of incident heart failure were identified.  At an index age of 55 years, during 502,252 person-years of follow-up, 2,976 cases of incident heart failure were identified.

At index age 45 and 55 years, people without hypertension, obesity and diabetes had a substantially lower risk for heart failure. This pattern was seen in men, women, white participants and black participants. Diabetes was found to have a particularly strong association with shorter heart failure-free survival, as those without diabetes lived on average between 8.6 and 10.6 years longer without heart failure.

Men at age 45 years without any of the three risk factors lived an average of 10.6 years longer free of heart failure, while women at age 45 without any of the three risk factors lived an average of 14.9 years longer without heart failure. White and black participants without risk factors lived 12.4 and 12.9 years longer, respectively. Similar trends were seen for index age 55 years.

""This study adds to the understanding of how individual and aggregate risk factor levels, specifically in middle age, affect incident heart failure risk over the remaining lifespan,"" said John T. Wilkins, M.D., M.S., from the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and senior author of the study. ""These findings help reframe the heart failure prevention discussion by quantifying how the prevention of the development of these risk factors can lengthen healthy and overall survival and could vastly reduce the population burden of heart failure.""",0

Feeding at the breast may be healthier than feeding pumped milk from a bottle for reducing the risk of ear infection, and feeding breast milk compared with formula may reduce the risk of diarrhea, according to a recent study by researchers at The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital.

""We certainly don't want women to stop pumping because there are not adequate data or guidelines about whether pumped breast milk is an equivalent substitute for feeding at the breast, so more research needs to be done,"" said Sarah Keim, PhD, senior author of the study and principal investigator in the Center for Biobehavioral Health in The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's.

A total of 491 mothers completed surveys as part of the study, published in the Journal of Pediatrics. Mothers who stated their intent to bottle-feed exclusively were not included in the study. In the remaining surveys, three out of four women used some combination of feeding from the breast, pumped milk and formula in the first 12 months of their children's lives.

After accounting for demographic and other related factors, researchers found that one month of feeding at the breast was associated with a 4 percent reduction in the odds of ear infection, and they found a 17 percent reduction in the odds for infants fed at the breast for six months of infancy Among infants who were fed only breast milk, either at the breast and/or pumped breast milk from a bottle, for the first six months, the odds of experiencing an ear infection increased by approximately 14 percent for infants fed pumped milk for 1 month and by 115 percent for infants fed with pumped milk for 6 months.

""While it is not completely clear why ear infections may be related to bottle feeding, it could be because bottles can create a negative pressure during feeding. This negative pressure is then transferred from the bottle to the middle ear of the infant during feedings, which may precipitate ear infections,"" explained Dr. Keim.

Infants fed with breast milk by either mode for six months had an approximately 30 percent reduced risk of diarrhea. Diarrhea risk was reduced by 25 percent for infants fed any breast milk for six months, and by 26 percent for infants fed at the breast for 6 months, while infants fed formula for 6 months had a 34% increased risk of experiencing diarrhea.

According to the researchers, this finding suggests that the substance fed, rather than the mode of feeding, may underlie differences in risk of diarrhea.

""This research begins to identify unique and separate associations of substance fed and mode of breast milk delivery, and demonstrates the importance of exploring these distinctive exposures in infant feeding research,"" said Kelly McNamara Boone, co-author on the study.

In addition to identifying the distinct contributions of both the substance fed and the mode of breast milk delivery to infant health, the study demonstrated large socioeconomic differences in feeding patterns. Mothers who fed their infants breast milk only were of greater socioeconomic status than those who fed their infants formula. Women who only used bottles (containing breast milk and/or formula) to feed their infants were of lower socioeconomic status than those who fed their infants at the breast.

""This finding is consistent with previous research that shows positive associations between socioeconomic status and breastfeeding. Initiation and duration of breastfeeding may be explained by health care and information resources available to and accessed by mothers of greater socioeconomic status,"" said Dr. Keim.

Scientists from the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute and their collaborators have discovered 17 rare human genetic variations associated with risk factors for diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. 

Reported in Nature Genetics, the research shows how large scale genomic datasets can be used to help identify potential novel biological targets for studying cardiovascular and other diseases.

Genetics have been implicated in cardiovascular and blood diseases for some time, however as these are complex diseases, it is extremely difficult to find specific genetic causes. In this study, scientists studied the genomes of almost 36,000 healthy people with European ancestry, looking for rare genetic links to 20 known risk factors for disease, such as raised levels of cholesterol or haemoglobin in the blood.

Two previous large-scale projects provided the whole genome sequences needed: the UK10K project  - a study of the genetic code of 10,000 people that aims to better understand links between rare genetic variations and disease; and the 1000 genome project. From this data, the scientists created a resource called a dense imputation panel, which is freely accessible to the scientific community. The panel holds so much detail that it can fill in the gaps or 'impute' data missing from lower resolution genetic studies. 

The level of detail the imputation panel provides enabled the scientists to look at specific disease risk factors, and find 17 new genetic variants. Of these, 16 would have been extremely difficult to find without the imputation panel data.

Professor Nicole Soranzo, joint senior author from the Sanger Institute, said: ""The dense imputation panel used in this study allowed us to search for genetic variations that are much less frequent than ever before, but that individually explain a greater genetic risk.  As efforts continue to characterise the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases, the methods we have developed in this study are expected to enable the next wave of discoveries of what causes these diseases, and how we might develop new treatments.""

Dr Valentina Iotchkova, first author from the Sanger Institute and the European Bioinformatics Institute said: ""This is the first stage of a discovery process that is going to tell us more about the contribution genetics makes to complex human diseases. We looked at where in the genome these 17 new variants lie to see what that could tell us about biology; about the changes they make to the body and how that could make a person more or less susceptible to disease.""

The researchers then applied an analytical technique called fine-mapping to study hundreds of regions of the human genome that contain genetic risk factors for cardiometabolic disease. For 59 regions, they were able to narrow down the most likely genetic causes to small sets of genetic variants. Combining this fine mapping technique with biological data drilled it down even further and provided additional functional insight into the underlying biology.

Dr Paul Auer, joint senior author on the paper from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee:  ""Our study provides a refined method to use the panel alongside other analysis techniques to find rare variants that contribute to complex genetic conditions like heart disease or diabetes. We have also narrowed down the set of potentially causal variants to a small set of variants for further follow up. We focused on cardiometabolic traits but the panel covers the entire human genome so it could be used to glean a deeper understanding of genetic contributions to disease in any part of the human body.""

A high proportion of 12-14 year olds are regularly consuming sports drinks socially, increasing their risk of obesity and tooth erosion, concludes a Cardiff University School of Dentistry survey.

Published in the British Dental Journal, the survey looked at 160 children in four schools across South Wales and concluded that children are attracted to sports drinks because of their sweet taste, low price, and availability, with most parents and children not aware that sports drinks are not intended for consumption by children.

Half of the children surveyed claimed to drink sports drinks socially and most (80%) purchased them in local shops. The majority (90%) also claimed that taste was a factor and only 18% claimed to drink them because of the perceived performance enhancing effect. Price was one of the top three recorded reasons for purchase and, of particular concern, 26% of children also cited leisure centres as purchase sources.

Maria Morgan, senior lecturer in dental public health at Cardiff University, said: ""The purpose of sports drinks are being misunderstood and this study clearly shows evidence of high school age children being attracted to these high sugar and low pH level drinks, leading to an increased risk of dental cavities, enamel erosion and obesity.

""Dental health professionals should be aware of the popularity of sports drinks with children when giving health education or advice or designing health promotion initiatives.""

The Faculty of Sport and Exercise Medicine (FSEM) is calling for tighter regulation around the price, availability and marketing of sports drinks to children, especially surrounding the school area, to safeguard general and dental health.

Dr Paul D Jackson, President of the FSEM UK, said: ""The proportion of children in this study who consume high carbohydrate drinks, which are designed for sport, in a recreational non-sporting context is of concern.

""Sports drinks are intended for athletes taking part in endurance and intense sporting events, they are also connected with tooth decay in athletes and should be used following the advice of dental and healthcare teams dedicated to looking after athletes. Water or milk is sufficient enough to hydrate active children, high sugar sports drinks are unnecessary for children and most adults.""    

Russ Ladwa, chair of the British Dental Association's Health and Science Committee, added: ""The rise of sports drinks as just another soft drink option among children is a real cause for concern, and both parents and government must take note. They are laden with acids and sugars, and could be behind the decay problems we're now seeing among top footballers. 

""Sports drinks are rarely a healthy choice, and marketing them to the general population, and young people in particular, is grossly irresponsible. Elite athletes might have reason to use them, but for almost everyone else they represent a real risk to both their oral and their general health.""

The survey also concluded that there is particular confusion over the definition of a sports versus an energy drink. However, from a dental and wider health perspective, these two drinks have similar detrimental effects due to their high sugar content and low pH.

In supermarkets and shops, sports drinks are often sold alongside other sugar sweetened beverages. This is misleading children and parents by indicating that they are meant for use by everyone.

Previous studies have associated obesity in women with insulin resistance, and obesity also appears to lead to difficulties with lactation. Now, it seems that maternal glucose intolerance, too, may make breastfeeding harder.

The benefits of breastfeeding for both mother and baby are well-documented, and all mothers are encouraged to breastfeed their infants, including mothers with diabetes. However, many women stop earlier, and the most commonly cited reason is low milk supply.

Mothers with diabetes have special considerations; research has shown that it can take longer for mothers with diabetes to start breastfeeding, possibly because of the role played by insulin in lactation.

In addition, breastfeeding can lower the need for insulin by up to 25%, because breast milk contains lactose, which is a sugar. Feeding the baby means a loss of sugar and a fall in blood glucose levels. Lactating mothers with diabetes should be aware of the potential change in blood sugar levels to prevent hypoglycemia.

The current study, thought to be the first to investigate the association between  maternal diabetes and low milk supply, could hold clues for future therapy options to increase milk supply.

Dr. Sarah Riddle, a pediatrician at the Center for Breastfeeding Medicine at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and colleagues studied electronic medical records of 641 women who first visited the center between June 2011 and May 2013.

All the participants had given birth within the previous 90 days, and they were all keen to breastfeed.

The team compared results for mothers with diabetes, mothers with low milk supply and no other breastfeeding problem, and mothers who were experiencing breastfeeding problems, such as latching onto the breast, but with a plentiful milk supply.

Lead author Dr. Riddle explained to Medical News Today that since the researchers were interested in any indication of abnormal glucose metabolism during pregnancy, they did not differentiate between types of diabetes.  She noted that some mothers with gestational diabetes may have had undiagnosed abnormal glucose metabolism before they became pregnant.

Results showed that nearly 15% of those with low milk supply had had diabetes during pregnancy. Just over 6% of mothers who had lactation problems unrelated to milk supply had maternal diabetes.
When MNT asked Dr. Riddle why she thought this might happen, she speculated that abnormal insulin action/glucose metabolism may cause difficulties in establishing and sustaining robust milk production, but she emphasized that far more research is needed to confirm a cause.

The study notes that there are currently few evidence-based strategies to help mothers to increase milk supply.

However, Dr. Riddle told MNT:
""We are hopeful that with a better understanding of the underlying physiology, targeted therapy may be designed to treat or perhaps prevent this problem. We are currently engaged in a small randomized controlled trial of metformin to treat low milk supply.""
MNT recently reported that the gut microbiome may be able to predict type 2 diabetes before symptoms show.

For optimal health and well-being, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommend adults aged 18-60 years get at least 7 hours of sleep every night.

However, earlier this year, a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed that more than a third of adults in the United States are not meeting these recommendations.

Lack of sleep has been linked to increased risk of numerous health problems, including high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.

Previous research has also associated changes in gut microbiota - the community of microorganisms that reside in the digestive tract - with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Whether sleep loss plays a role in this relationship, however, has been unclear.

According to the researchers of the new study - including first author Christian Benedict of the Department of Neuroscience at Uppsala University in Sweden - some studies in mice and humans have suggested that gut bacteria have a circadian rhythm that might be disrupted by sleep loss.

""However, to date, there are no studies that have investigated the impact of insufficient sleep on the composition of the human gut microbiota,"" they add.

""Studies are therefore lacking that assess whether important adverse metabolic changes that may increase the risk of [type 2 diabetes] and obesity, such as impaired insulin sensitivity, are associated with changes in the gut microbiome and associated SCFAs [short chain fatty acids] that could result from recurrent sleep loss.""

To find out more about the link between sleep loss, gut microbiota, and metabolic changes, Benedict and team enrolled nine healthy, normal-weight males to their study.

The researchers analyzed fecal samples from the men after two sleep conditions: 1 day of normal sleep (around 8 hours) and 2 days of restricted sleep (around 4 hours each night).

Meal times and food intake can affect the composition of gut bacteria, so these were kept consistent across both sleep conditions.

While the team found no evidence that sleep loss alters the diversity of gut bacteria, their analysis did identify changes in microbiota - such as an increase in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteriodetes - that previous studies have associated with obesity.

Additionally, the researchers found that following sleep restriction, subjects showed a 20 percent reduction in sensitivity to insulin - the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels.

""This decreased insulin sensitivity was however unrelated to alterations in gut microbiota following sleep loss,"" says Benedict. ""This suggests that changes in microbiota may not, at least in the short-term, represent a central mechanism through which one or several nights of curtailed sleep reduce insulin sensitivity in humans.""

While these findings suggest sleep loss can trigger changes in gut bacteria, the researchers say further investigation is warranted to better understand whether these changes influence metabolic health.

The authors add:
""Given our small sample size that only involved healthy young men, larger and more long-term studies are required to investigate to what extent these findings persist over longer time periods and whether these are observed in females, older or diseased patients and in other sleep restriction paradigms. 

Nevertheless, our study is the first to provide evidence for sleep deprivation-induced changes in microbial families of bacterial gut species, which have previously been linked to metabolic pathologies.""

Resveratrol, a compound found commonly in grape skins and red wine, has been shown to have several potentially beneficial effects on health, including cardiovascular health, stroke prevention and cancer treatments. However, scientists do not yet fully understand how the chemical works and whether or not it can be used for treatment of diseases in humans and animals.

Now, researchers at the University of Missouri have found that resveratrol does affect the immune systems of dogs in different ways when introduced to dogs' blood. Sandra Axiak-Bechtel, an assistant professor in oncology at the MU College of Veterinary Medicine, said this is a first step in determining how the chemical causes immune systems to react.

""This study makes it clear that resveratrol does cause the immune systems of dogs to change, but the changes it causes have created more questions,"" Axiak-Bechtel said. ""We found that resveratrol simultaneously causes dogs' immune systems to increase and decrease in different ways. If we can better understand why resveratrol makes these changes and learn to control them, the chemical may have valuable uses in treatments of cancer and other diseases in dogs and humans.""

For their study, Axiak-Bechtel; Rowena Woode, a veterinary medical student in the MU College of Veterinary Medicine; and Amy DeClue, an associate professor in the MU College of Veterinary Medicine; added resveratrol to canine blood and measured innate immune system function. They found that resveratrol caused the stimulated white blood cells to release more pro-inflammatory and fewer anti-inflammatory cytokines, which are signals cells use to communicate with each other during infection and inflammation. These cytokines point to a stimulated immune system. However, the researchers also observed a decrease in the ability neutrophils, which are immune cells that help fight diseases, to kill bacteria. Axiak-Bechtel says this points to decreased immune system strength.

""Seeing a decrease in neutrophil function typically means an immune system is losing the ability to kill invaders like bacteria,"" Axiak-Bechtel said. ""Combining this loss of bacteria-fighting ability with an increase in inflammatory cytokines creates a very interesting mixed message in terms of what resveratrol is doing to the immune system. It is clear that resveratrol is having a distinct effect on how the immune system reacts, but we still don't fully understand how this reaction can be best used to fight disease. Once we have a better understanding of this process, resveratrol could be a valuable supplementary treatment in fighting diseases like cancer.""

Updating their 2009 position on plant-based diets, the Academy say an ""appropriately planned"" vegetarian or vegan diet is suitable for ""all stages of the life cycle,"" and adopting such diets in childhood can reduce the risk of chronic disease later in life.

Additionally, the paper says plant-based diets are more environmentally friendly and sustainable than diets rich in animal products, noting that they can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50 percent.

""Becoming vegetarian can be beneficial to personal health and the environment,"" says Vandana Sheth, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

The new paper was recently published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

According to a 2016 poll from The Vegetarian Resource Group, around 3.3 percent of adults in the United States are vegetarian or vegan.

While a vegetarian diet is widely perceived as a diet that simply excludes meat, poultry, and fish, there are many variations. 

These include a lacto-vegetarian diet (devoid of meat, poultry, and fish, but includes dairy products) and a pescatarian diet (excludes meat, poultry, dairy, and eggs, but allows fish). A vegan diet excludes meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, and animal-derived products. It may also exclude honey.

A number of studies have hailed the health benefits of a plant-based diet, which include a lower risk of obesity and diabetes. However, some studies have suggested that vegetarian diets may do more harm than good.

One study published in 2014, for example, linked a vegetarian diet to increased risk of allergies, cancer, and mental health disorders. Such health issues have been put down to lack of essential nutrients from animal products.

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, however, say a ""well-planned"" plant-based diet - high in vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains - can offer a wealth of health benefits.

For the new paper - written by nutritionist Susan Levin of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington, D.C., and co-authors - the Academy reviewed a variety of studies looking at the effects of plant-based diets on health and the environment.

From the evidence to date, the authors say adopting a plant-based diet can reduce the risk of prostate cancer by 35 percent, while overall cancer risk can be reduced by 18 percent with a plant-based diet.

In terms of heart health, the Academy say a plant-based diet can lower the risk of heart attack by 32 percent and the risk of heart disease by 10-29 percent.

Furthermore, the authors say the risk of type 2 diabetes may be reduced by 62 percent with a plant-based diet.

""People who adopt vegetarian diets have lower body mass indexes [BMIs], better control of blood pressure and blood glucose, less inflammation and lower cholesterol levels compared with non-vegetarians,"" notes Sheth. ""Registered dietitian nutritionists can help people who want to follow a vegetarian eating plan in any life stage to make well-informed choices to achieve these benefits.""

The paper notes that a plant-based diet in childhood and adolescence may have significant benefits for current and later-life health.

The authors point to studies that have shown children and adolescents with a vegetarian diet are less likely to be overweight or obese than their meat-eating counterparts.

""Children and adolescents with BMI values in the normal range are more likely to also be within the normal range as adults, resulting in significant disease risk reduction,"" they add.

""Other benefits of a vegetarian diet in childhood and adolescence include greater consumption of fruits and vegetables, fewer sweets and salty snacks, and lower intakes of total and saturated fat. Consuming balanced vegetarian diets early in life can establish healthful lifelong habits.""

The authors also point to the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet, noting that a vegetarian diet and a vegan diet can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 29 percent and 50 percent, respectively.

They say this is because vegetarian diets use less water, fossil fuel resources, pesticides, and fertilizers than meat-based diets.

As an example, the authors say producing 1 kilogram of protein from kidney beans would require ""18 times less land, 10 times less water, nine times less fuel, 12 times less fertilizer, and 10 times less pesticide in comparison to producing 1 kilogram of protein from beef.""

Concluding their paper, the American Academy of Dietetics say that, compared with omnivorous diets, vegetarian diets can protect our health and the environment.
""If you could bottle up a plant-based prescription, it would become a blockbuster drug overnight. This way of eating creates an efficient energy source not just for the planet, but for our bodies. 

What other drug increases metabolism, lowers blood pressure, stabilizes blood sugar, and instead of increasing the risk for heart disease or diabetes - stops it in its tracks?""Susan Levin

Obesity is one of the most visible, yet most neglected public health problems, with an escalating global epidemic of overweight and obesity reaching many parts of the world.

Around 600 million people worldwide are affected by obesity, with the condition significantly increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis and some cancers.

Evidence supporting the link between obesity and metabolic and cardiovascular diseases has accumulated since the 1940s. However, experts began to question in the 1970s and 80s the extent to which obesity increases the risk for these disorders.  

Furthermore, studies in the late 90s and early 2000s found that not all obese individuals experienced a greater risk of metabolic and cardiovascular complications, and, in fact, they displayed a relatively healthy metabolic and cardiovascular profile, hence the term ""metabolically healthy obesity.""

While no universally accepted criteria exist to define metabolically healthy obesity, a potential hallmark of the condition is a high sensitivity to insulin, a hormone that promotes uptake of blood glucose into cells to be used for energy. 

Estimates suggest that up to 30 percent of obese individuals are metabolically healthy and, as a result, may not need as much intervention to prevent obesity-related complications.

Mikael Rydén, of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, and colleagues examined the responses to insulin in 15 healthy participants and 50 obese subjects who were enrolled in a gastric bypass surgery clinical study.

Biopsies of abdominal white fat tissue were obtained at the start and end of a 2-hour period of insulin and glucose received by intravenous infusion. Based on the glucose uptake rate, 21 obese individuals were classified as insulin sensitive, and 29 classed as insulin resistant. 

Analysis of white fat tissue samples revealed a clear difference between healthy participants and insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant obese individuals.

In response to insulin stimulation, white fat tissue from both obese groups showed almost identical abnormal patterns of gene expression, which were not influenced by cardiovascular or metabolic risk factors such as waist-to-hip ratio, heart rate, or blood pressure.

The researchers uncover that obesity - rather than other common risk factors - is likely the principle factor affecting metabolic health.

""Our study suggests that the notion of metabolically healthy obesity may be more complicated than previously thought, at least in subcutaneous adipose tissue,"" says Rydén. 

""There doesn't appear to be a clear transcriptomic fingerprint that differentiates obese subjects with high or low insulin sensitivity, indicating that obesity per se is the major driver explaining the changes in gene expression,"" he adds.

Study limitations include that gene expression profiles were only examined in white fat tissue and not other types of fatty tissue or other organs. Also, all obese participants were due to go through bariatric surgery, suggesting the finding may only apply to obese individuals at the severe end of the scale.

Overall, the study finds that white fat tissue samples from obese individuals classified as either metabolically healthy or unhealthy show almost identical, abnormal changes in gene expression in response to insulin stimulation.

""The findings suggest that vigorous health interventions may be necessary for all obese individuals, even those previously considered to be metabolically healthy. Since obesity is the major driver altering gene expression in fat tissue, we should continue to focus on preventing obesity.""
Mikael Rydén
""Insulin-sensitive obese individuals may not be as metabolically healthy as previously believed,"" says Rydén. ""Therefore, more vigorous interventions may be necessary in these individuals to prevent cardiovascular and metabolic complications,"" he concludes.

Future studies by the team will concentrate on tracking study participants after bariatric surgery to determine whether the associated weight loss normalizes gene expression responses to insulin. Additionally, Rydén and his collaborators will investigate particular genes linked to improved metabolic health in these people.

A large-scale genetic study has provided strong evidence that the development of insulin resistance - a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and heart attacks and one of the key adverse consequences of obesity - results from the failure to safely store excess fat in the body.
 
Overeating and lack of physical activity worldwide has led to rising levels of obesity and a global epidemic of diseases such as heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. A key process in the development of these diseases is the progressive resistance of the body to the actions of insulin, a hormone that controls the levels of blood sugar. When the body becomes resistant to insulin, levels of blood sugars and lipids rise, increasing the risk of diabetes and heart disease. However, it is not clear in most cases how insulin resistance arises and why some people become resistant, particularly when overweight, while others do not. 
 
An international team led by researchers at the University of Cambridge studied over two million genetic variants in almost 200,000 people to look for links to insulin resistance. In an article published in Nature Genetics, they report 53 regions of the genome associated with insulin resistance and higher risk of diabetes and heart disease; only 10 of these regions have previously been linked to insulin resistance. 
 
The researchers then carried out a follow-up study with over 12,000 participants in the Fenland and EPIC-Norfolk studies, each of whom underwent a body scan that shows fat deposits in different regions of the body. They found that having a greater number of the 53 genetic variants for insulin resistance was associated with having lower amounts of fat under the skin, particularly in the lower half of the body.
 
The team also found a link between having a higher number of the 53 genetic risk variants and a severe form of insulin resistance characterized by loss of fat tissue in the arms and legs, known as familial partial lipodystrophy type 1. Patients with lipodystrophy are unable to adequately develop fat tissue when eating too much, and often develop diabetes and heart disease as a result.
 
In follow-up experiments in mouse cells, the researchers were also able to show that suppression of several of the identified genes (including CCDC92, DNAH10 and L3MBTL3) results in an impaired ability to develop mature fat cells.
 
""Our study provides compelling evidence that a genetically-determined inability to store fat under the skin in the lower half of the body is linked to a higher risk of conditions such as diabetes and heart disease,"" says Dr Luca Lotta from the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge. ""Our results highlight the important biological role of peripheral fat tissue as a deposit of the surplus of energy due to overeating and lack of physical exercise."" 
 
""We've long suspected that problems with fat storage might lead to its accumulation in other organs such as the liver, pancreas and muscles, where it causes insulin resistance and eventually diabetes, but the evidence for this has mostly come from rare forms of human lipodystrophy,"" adds Professor Sir Stephen O'Rahilly from the MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit and Metabolic Research Laboratories at the University of Cambridge. ""Our study suggests that these processes also take place in the general population.""
 
Overeating and being physically inactive leads to excess energy, which is stored as fat tissue. This new study suggests that among individuals who have similar levels of eating and physical exercise, those who are less able store the surplus energy as fat in the peripheral body, such as the legs, are at a higher risk of developing insulin resistance, diabetes and cardiovascular disease than those who are able to do so. 
 
""People who carry the genetic risk variants that we've identified store less fat in peripheral areas,"" says Professor Nick Wareham, also from the MRC Epidemiology Unit. ""But this does not mean that they are free from risk of disease, because when their energy intake exceeds expenditure, excess fat is more likely to be stored in unhealthy deposits. The key to avoiding the adverse effects is the maintenance of energy balance by limiting energy intake and maximising expenditure through physical activity.""
 
These new findings may lead to future improvements in the way we prevent and treat insulin resistance and its complications. The researchers are now collaborating with other academic as well as industry partners with the aim of finding drugs that may reduce the risk of diabetes and heart attack by targeting the identified pathways.
 
The research was mainly funded by the Medical Research Council, with additional support from the Wellcome Trust.

According to an FDA statement, marijuana is listed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) - this is the most restrictive schedule. The FDA agrees with this Schedule I listing, as does the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).    

The three criteria for placement in Schedule I, says the FDA (21 U.S.C 812b 1) are currently met by Marijuana.  It listed as the three main reasons against the use of marijuana for medical use as:    

1. It has a high potential for abuse  
2. It has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the USA  
3. It has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision   

The FDA also added that current evidence shows marijuana is harmful to human health.  It cited several studies and reports done by HHS, FDA, SAMHSA and NIDA, which indicate that scientific evidence supporting marijuana's medical use is lacking (for treatment in the USA).  Also, the FDA said animal or human data supporting efficacy and safety of marijuana for general medical use is lacking.    

There are alternatives (approved by the FDA) to smoking marijuana for medical use, said the agency.    

The FDA's role is to make sure a drug is safe and effective before it is allowed into the market.    

The agency went on to say that without clear evidence of safety and efficacy through well regulated clinical trials, it cannot approve a drug.  It would not serve the interests of public health, as patients would be exposed to ineffective and potentially dangerous drug products.    

The agency criticised moves made by a number of states to make smoked marijuana available for some medical conditions (upon a doctor's recommendation).  11 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medical purposes.  The FDA has no power in enforcing its statement on those states (would be the role of the DEA).    

Saying there is no sound scientific study contradicts a study carried out in 1999 by the Institute of Medicine.  This study did find some benefits in using marijuana for particular conditions.

No one wants to talk about diarrhea. More so, no one wants to experience it. Unfortunately, diarrhea is often the body's natural way of expelling waste in liquid form when a bacterial or viral infection, or parasite is present.

However, there are other things that can cause diarrhea for everyone, and some things that can cause diarrhea specifically in those with diabetes.

Contents of this article:

There are various things that can cause diarrhea.

These include:

In some cases, such as with illness or the use of sugar alcohols, diarrhea does not last for long. It tends to stop once the illness is over or the person stops using sugar alcohols.

With metformin, the symptoms can go away with time. Some people in whom the diarrhea does not resolve may need to stop taking the medication, however.

Bowel diseases may cause lasting problems for people with these conditions.  Diarrhea and other symptoms can be managed or controlled with lifestyle changes such as stress reduction, and medications as needed.  People with type 1 diabetes are at higher risk of celiac disease, and should check for this if long-term diarrhea is a problem for them.
 
A long-term complication associated with diabetes that can lead to long-term diarrhea (and constipation) is called autonomic neuropathy.

Autonomic neuropathy occurs when there is damage to the nerves that control how the body works.  Autonomic neuropathy can affect the nerves that control all automatic bodily functions such as heart rate, sweating, and bowel function.

Since diabetes is the most common cause of autonomic neuropathy, people with long-term diabetes complications struggle with the effects the disease has on their nervous system.

Reports show as many as 75 percent of patients visiting diabetes clinics will report significant symptoms affecting the gut.

Diabetes can affect the entire gut, from the mouth to the anus. As a result, it's no wonder that people with diabetes can report higher instances of diarrhea.

A doctor will diagnose diarrhea after reviewing the patient's medical history, symptoms, and length of time the problem has persisted. While every person's bowel movements are different, there are some clinical signs that indicate when a medical problem is present.

Symptoms sometimes seen with diarrhea include loss of appetite, bloating, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and heartburn. These symptoms should be discussed with a physician, especially since they can lead to dehydration.

When speaking to a doctor, a patient should know:

When it comes to testing for and treating diarrhea, all the above conditions can contribute. People should keep a record of foods that may affect their condition.

Diarrhea may clear up on its own with time. However, a doctor may decide to run some tests in some cases. The decision to run tests is based on many factors. These factors include those listed below.

For cases of short-term diarrhea:

For cases of long-term diarrhea:

Treatment for diarrhea depends on the cause.  If caused by illness, treatment involves letting the bacteria or parasite that caused the condition be eliminated from the body and allowing time to heal. Regardless of the cause, there are some standard treatments that people with diarrhea will benefit from. 

The first step in treating any form of diarrhea is to drink water. Patients need to replace the lost fluids so that they do not become dehydrated. People with severe cases of diarrhea may need to be given fluids directly into their veins.

Other treatments include:

A study of more than 16,000 people in the United States revealed that individuals who consumed red chili peppers had a lower risk of death from all causes over an average of 18 years than those who did not eat the spicy food.

Study co-authors Mustafa Chopan and Benjamin Littenberg, both from the University of Vermont College of Medicine, recently reported their findings in the journal PLOS One.

Chili peppers are the fruits of the Capsicum plant, which belongs to the nightshade family. There are many types of chili pepper, all of which have different heat levels.

In hot peppers, such as jalapeños, the fiery flavor comes from a compound called capsaicin. Studies have suggested that this compound can offer a wealth of health benefits.

A recent study reported by Medical News Today, for example, found that capsaicin might have the potential to halt breast cancer, while an earlier study linked the compound to a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.

According to Chopan and Littenberg, only one previous study - published in The BMJ in 2015 - has investigated how the consumption of spicy foods such as chili peppers can impact death risk. It found a link between regular consumption of such foods and reduced all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

The new study supports this association, after finding that people who eat hot red chili peppers might have a longer lifespan.

Chopan and Littenberg reached their findings by analyzing the data of 16,179 adults aged 18 or above who took part in the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey III between 1988 and 1994.

At the point of survey, participants' consumption of hot red chili peppers over the past month was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire.

The all-cause and cause-specific mortality of participants were monitored over a median follow-up period of 18.9 years using the National Death Index. During follow-up, 4,946 deaths occurred.

Compared with participants who did not consume hot red chili peppers, those who did were found to be at a 13 percent reduced risk of all-cause mortality.

Because of the relatively small number of deaths in this study, Chopan and Littenberg say that their data on how red chili pepper intake might impact specific causes of death is limited.

Still, the available data suggested that hot red chili pepper consumption was most strongly associated with a reduced risk of death from vascular diseases, such as heart disease and stroke.

While the researchers are unable the pinpoint the precise mechanisms by which red chili peppers might extend lifespan, the team says that it is likely down to capsaicin, which activities transient receptor potential (TRP) channels.

""Activation of TRP vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) appears to stimulate cellular mechanisms against obesity, by altering mediators of lipid catabolism and thermogenesis,"" the researchers explain. ""Protection against obesity leads to decreased risk of cardiovascular, metabolic, and lung diseases.""

""Capsaicin may also defend against heart disease via a TRP-mediated modulation of coronary blood flow,"" they add.

Overall, the team says that these latest findings support those of the 2015 study, linking spicy food intake to reduced risk of death by showing ""a significant decrease in mortality associated with hot red chili pepper consumption.""

However, Chopan and Littenberg note that the earlier study was only conducted in Chinese adults, so the new research ""strengthens the generalizability"" of those findings.

The team concludes that:
""Given the observational nature of both investigations, causality can only be suggested, not confirmed. Further studies should aim to investigate the benefits of other spices and differential effects of certain chili pepper subtypes. Such evidence may lead to new insights into the relationships between diet and health, updated dietary recommendations, and the development of new therapies.""

In 2003, the British people were told by the authorities that teenagers and children should not be given SSRI  antidepressants  after medical professionals were concerned that some of them became suicidal while others experienced serious mood swings.  Prozac continued to be recommended, for under 18s, but only in cases of severe  depression .    

So, why is it that in 2004-2005 over 84,000 children in the UK are still on such drugs?  Over 27,000 of those under 15.    

The 2004-2005 figures were made public after the Liberal Democrats asked for it in Parliament.    

According to Paul Burstow, LibDem Health Spokesperson, doctors are carrying on prescribing these drugs despite warnings by experts that they can lead to an increased risk of suicide.  He added that the ‘shocking over-reliance on the use of these drugs demonstrates yet again the chronic shortage of talking therapies and the weakness of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. These figures should be ringing alarm bells at the Department of Health and calling into question the way in which advice on medicines is monitored.'    

The UK Dept of Health says some of these medications are used for other indications such as bed-wetting,  anxiety ,  obsessive compulsive disorder  and some  phobias .

Daily cups of tea can help you recover more quickly from the stresses of everyday life, according to a new study by UCL (University College London) researchers. New scientific evidence shows that black tea has an effect on  stress  hormone levels in the body.    

The study, published in the journal Psychopharmacology, found that people who drank tea were able to de-stress more quickly than those who drank a fake tea substitute. Furthermore, the study participants - who drank a black tea concoction four times a day for six weeks - were found to have lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol in their blood after a stressful event, compared with a control group who drank the fake or  placebo  tea for the same period of time.    

In the study, 75 young male regular tea drinkers were split into two groups and monitored for six weeks. They all gave up their normal tea,  coffee  and caffeinated beverages, then one group was given a fruit-flavoured caffeinated tea mixture made up of the constituents of an average cup of black tea. The other group - the control group - was given a caffeinated placebo identical in taste, but devoid of the active tea ingredients. All drinks were tea-coloured, but were designed to mask some of the normal sensory cues associated with tea drinking (such as smell, taste and familiarity of the brew), to eliminate confounding factors such as the ?comforting' effect of drinking a cup of tea.   

Both groups were subjected to challenging tasks, while their cortisol,  blood pressure , blood platelet and self-rated levels of stress were measured. In one task, volunteers were exposed to one of three stressful situations (threat of unemployment, a shop lifting accusation or an incident in a nursing home), where they had to prepare a verbal response and argue their case in front of a camera.    

The tasks triggered substantial increases in blood pressure, heart rate and subjective stress ratings in both of the groups. In other words, similar stress levels were induced in both groups. However, 50 minutes after the task, cortisol levels had dropped by an average of 47 per cent in the tea drinking group compared with 27 per cent in the fake tea group.   

UCL researchers also found that blood platelet activation - linked to blood clotting and the risk of  heart attacks  - was lower in the tea drinkers, and that this group reported a greater degree of relaxation in the recovery period after the task.    

Professor Andrew Steptoe, UCL Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, says: ?Drinking tea has traditionally been associated with stress relief, and many people believe that drinking tea helps them relax after facing the stresses of everyday life. However, scientific evidence for the relaxing properties of tea is quite limited.  This is one of the first studies to assess tea in a double-blind placebo controlled design - that is, neither we nor the participants knew whether they were drinking real or fake tea.     This means that any differences were due to the biological ingredients of tea, and not to the relaxing situations in which people might drink tea, whether they were familiar with the taste and liked it, and so on.   

?We do not know what ingredients of tea were responsible for these effects on stress recovery and relaxation.  Tea is chemically very complex, with many different ingredients. Ingredients such as catechins, polyphenols, flavonoids and amino acids have been found to have effects on neurotransmitters in the brain, but we cannot tell from this research which ones produced the differences.   

?Nevertheless, our study suggests that drinking black tea may speed up our recovery from the daily stresses in life. Although it does not appear to reduce the actual levels of stress we experience, tea does seem to have a greater effect in bringing stress hormone levels back to normal. This has important health implications, because slow recovery following acute stress has been associated with a greater risk of chronic illnesses such as  coronary heart disease .?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that birth defects affect approximately 3 percent of babies born each year in the United States, and they are the leading cause of death among infants. 

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are major birth defects affecting the baby's spine and brain. The abnormalities may develop very early in the formation of the embryo, as soon as the neural tube is formed. The neural tube normally goes on to become the spinal cord, spinal column, and brain of the baby. 

Folic acid has been shown to prevent NTDs if administered just before the pregnancy and during its earliest stages. According to the CDC, since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduced folic acid fortification in some foods in 1998, 1,300 potential cases of NTD have been avoided every year. 

In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) also recommended supplementary folic acid intake for women of childbearing age.

A new report from the USPSTF updates its previous guidelines, recommending that all women capable of reproduction or who are planning to have a baby take a daily supplement of folic acid in order to prevent NTDs. 


The new report from the USPSTF, published in  JAMA, assesses emerging evidence of the health benefits and potential harms of using folic acid as daily supplementation. 

Research collected between 2009-2011 reports an incidence of 6.5 cases of anencephaly and spina bifida - two of the most common forms of NTD - per 10,000 live births. 

Folic acid can be found naturally in plant foods. Dark green leafy vegetables - such as spinach, broccoli, and asparagus, beans and other legumes, as well as citrus fruits - are all high in folate. However, studies referenced by the report show that most women do not get the recommended daily dose of folic acid exclusively from diet. 

In fact, the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed that around 75 percent of women aged between 15-44 do not receive the daily intake necessary for preventing NTDs. 

The USPSTF conclude that the net benefits of taking a folic acid supplementation are ""substantial,"" and they have therefore issued a grade A recommendation. 

Most NTDs develop in the first month of pregnancy - often before a mother even knows she is pregnant. As a result, the report deems the period starting at least 1 month before conception and lasting through the first 2-3 months of pregnancy as ""critical"" for daily supplementation.

The USPSTF recommend that women who are capable of getting pregnant or planning to do so take a supplement of 0.4-0.8 milligrams - or 400-800 micrograms - of folic acid daily. 

The recommendations do not concern women who are at a very high risk of NTDs due to hereditary factors, previous use of antiepileptic drugs, or mothers who have already had a pregnancy affected by the defects. These women, the report cautions, may require a higher dose of the folate. 

Common risk factors for NTDs include diabetes or obesity in the mother, or mutations in the enzymes responsible for metabolizing folate. 

The report acknowledges that there are still insufficiently addressed issues regarding folic acid consumption and supplemental needs. For example, folate consumption, the prevalence of mutations in folate-related enzymes, and NTD prevalence all vary according to race and ethnicity. Future research should, therefore, look into how recommended dosage could reflect these needs.

Overall, however, when balancing the harms and benefits of the recommended dose of 400-800 micrograms per day, the report found adequate evidence that the harms are ""no greater than small.""

As a result, the report concludes ""with high certainty"" that the benefits of the recommended daily supplemental intake are substantial.

The negative health effects of consuming large amounts of fructose could impact several generations, according to researchers at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.

The UTMB study found that when pregnant mice only drink water sweetened with fructose, a common sweetener in foods and beverages, their offspring have several more risk factors for heart disease, compared with mice who only drank water throughout pregnancy. These findings were recently published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

The study could have worldwide implications for people because a large proportion of processed foods and carbonated beverages contain high-fructose syrup and other fructose-based sweeteners. Recent studies support a connection between fructose consumption and the rise in rates of cardiovascular disease, obesity and Type 2 diabetes.

In the UTMB study, the researchers investigated the impact that high levels of fructose consumption throughout pregnancy had on the offspring when they are adults.

Throughout their pregnancy, the researchers gave pregnant mice either only water or a 10 percent fructose drink that mimics the level of fructose in most soft drinks. Otherwise, the diets were the same for both the water and fructose groups. After weaning, the pups were provided water and a normal mouse diet and evaluated after a year. A year is considered middle aged for mice since their life expectancy is about two years.

Antonio Saad, a UTMB fellow in Maternal Fetal Medicine, and his team measured percent of abdominal fat tissue and liver fat using computed tomography, or CT, scanning. They conducted blood tests to measure glucose concentrations, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides and leptin-a hormone made by fat cells that helps regulate energy balance by blunting hunger.

They found that both female and male offspring in the fructose group had higher peak glucose levels and higher blood pressure. Female offspring of the fructose group also were heavier and had higher percentages of abdominal fat tissue, liver fat and insulin resistance as well as lower concentrations of leptin compared with their water group counterparts. None of the mice showed any differences in total cholesterol or triglycerides, regardless of group or gender.

""We found that when the mother has a high intake of fructose in her diet throughout pregnancy, her offspring is more at risk of developing adult obesity, high blood pressure and metabolic dysfunction, all of which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease,"" said Saad. ""This effect is more pronounced in female offspring. Limiting intake of high fructose-enriched foods and beverages during pregnancy may have a great impact on the child's future health.""

electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for severe cases when patients do not respond to other therapies.    

This study focuses on patients who have not responded to antidepressant medication for their depression. Rush is one of 16 

academic medical centers participating in this nationwide clinical trial. Smaller preliminary studies using TMS produced an 

antidepressant effect and led to the current research project. Information from this larger, more rigorous trial will be 

provided to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to support regulatory clearance of the Neuronetics TMS System for use in 

treating depression.    

The double-blind study will test the new treatment while controlling for this so-called "" placebo  effect."" Janicak explained 

that this study, which includes a placebo (or sham) treatment, is needed because some patients improve simply due to the 

added attention they receive in a research study. Neither the doctor nor the patient will know which treatment, the active 

TMS or the placebo, is being used. After the initial treatment phase (four to six weeks), however, patients can be given the 

real TMS treatment if their symptoms have not improved.    

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) produces pulses of magnetic energy that are aimed at a specific portion of the brain, 

the left prefrontal cortex. Researchers believe the left prefrontal cortex is involved in regulating mood.    

TMS produces the same amount of magnetic energy as a standard  MRI  machine. However, instead of helping doctors look inside 

the body to diagnose disease, the pulses of magnetic energy produce an electric field that researchers believe causes 

positive changes in mood.    

""The amount of energy delivered to the brain is very small and very focused,"" Janicak said. Patients remain fully awake 

during the 45-minute outpatient procedure and can go about their normal activity before and after the procedure. TMS is 

performed without anesthesia, and it does not cause memory loss as is sometimes found with the use of ECT. Patients who 

qualify for the trial will initially receive 30 sessions over a period of six weeks.    

The National Institute of Mental Health reports that depression affects more than 18 million adults every year. Even with 

recent advances in antidepressant medications, a significant percentage of patients experience treatment-resistant or 

recurrent episodes of depression. Some patients cannot tolerate medications.    

This new research study, which involves hundreds of patients nationwide, will be a pivotal trial. If the results of the study 

are positive and the TMS procedure is approved by the U.S. FDA, an entirely new treatment option for patients suffering from 

depression would be available.    

Rush is inviting qualified patients to volunteer to participate in this study. To qualify, patients must be:    
-- between 18 and 70 years old.    
-- suffering from a major depressive disorder.    
-- able to provide written documentation that they have been unsuccessfully treated previously with antidepressant 

medication.    
Patients who have been diagnosed with bipolar illness (manic depression) or  obsessive-compulsive disorder  are not eligible to 

participate in the trial.

Depression is common among opiate users and may serve as a trigger for high-risk drug injection practices, continued drug use, and relapse. Research has shown that individuals with co-occurring  depression  and substance use are less likely to complete treatment and have poorer prognoses after traditional treatment. However, scientists at the Brown University School of Medicine demonstrated that multisession, combination  antidepressant  therapy successfully reduced depression in active injection drug users.    
Dr. Michael Stein and colleagues recruited 109 out-of-treatment injection drug users diagnosed with depression to participate in the study. Fifty-three participants received combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for their depression during a 3-month period.    These participants were scheduled to receive eight individual  cognitive behavioral therapy  (CBT) sessions and three pharmacotherapy visits. Fifty-six participants did not receive treatment. At the end of 3 months, adherence to treatment was assessed, and all study members participated in follow-up interviews designed to assess their heroin use and severity of depression.    

Forty-three percent of participants receiving the combined treatment were considered to be fully adherent to their treatment schedules (receiving more than 75 percent of either psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy). At follow-up, significant reductions in depression were observed.    

Participants receiving the combined treatment were about 2.5 times more likely than those not receiving treatment to be in depression remission. Nearly 40 percent of participants who were fully adherent to treatment were in remission at 3 months, while only about 12 percent of those not receiving treatment were in remission at this time.    Among all participants, depression status was associated with frequency of heroin use. Participants in remission at 3 months reported fewer than 8 days of heroin use during that time compared with roughly 13 days of heroin use among those not in remission.    

WHAT IT MEANS:    These findings indicate that depressed drug abusers are able to successfully participate in conventional treatment for depression, and for those who are adherent, depression remission is not uncommon. However, most  mental health  and drug treatment programs do not provide integrated treatment for their dually diagnosed patients. Developing and improving programs for patients with co-occurring depression and substance abuse disorders who do not seek drug treatment may be important as a potential prelude to entry into drug treatment.    

The study was published in the February 2004 issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry. It was funded in part by NIDA.

Students who increase their physical activity during their middle-school years have fewer symptoms of  depression , according to a new study.    
Higher levels of physical activity at the start of the seventh grade were tied to lower levels of depression at the same point, while increased activity over the two years of the study was associated with reduced depressive symptoms at the end of the study, say Rod K. Dishman, Ph.D., of the University of Georgia and colleagues.   

Their research appeared in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine.   

“A naturally occurring change in physical activity across time was inversely associated with a change in levels of depressive symptoms across time,” Dishman says.   

The practical magnitude of the change was small — affecting about 3 percent of the students — but statistically significant, he says, comparing it to the 8 percent effect found in a clinical trial of an SSRI, a common type of  antidepressant  medication.   

The of 4,594 Minnesota students were asked if they got 20 minutes of exercise at least three times a week and took a standard test for adolescent depression. Other factors, like smoking, gender, alcohol use, socioeconomic status and attitudes about health, appearance and achievement were recorded too, but had no effect on the outcomes.   

The children’s frequency of physical activity increased early in the study, but then leveled off. Dishman warned that stable levels of physical activity coupled with an increase in depression expected in early adolescence means parents and educators should take steps to keep children increasingly active.
   
Physical activity should be considered along with other preventive or treatment approaches to depression, like antidepressant drugs or psychotherapy, Dishman says. Furthermore, exercise has the benefit of being cheap and accessible and has few side effects.
   
“It is important to investigate the efficacy of low-risk interventions for reducing depression symptoms, such as physical activity, that may be more acceptable to youth and their families,” he says.

Electrical deep brain stimulation can dramatically alleviate  depression  that is resistant to other treatments, 

researchers have found in an initial study on six patients. The finding is important, they said, because up to 20 percent of 

patients with depression fail to respond to standard treatments--requiring combinations of  antidepressant  drugs, 

psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) that still may fail. The number of resistant depression patients can be 

large, since depression is the leading source of disability in adults under age 50 in North America.    
The 6 month study led by Helen Mayberg of Emory University School of Medicine and colleagues showed that the patients 

reported immediate improvements in mood when the electrical stimulation of a few volts was applied to the implanted 

electrodes. These effects persisted in four of the patients for the full 6 months, with three patients achieving remission or 

near remission of the depression. No psychological side effects were reported, and other adverse effects were limited to 

minor infections around the implant site, which were treatable with  antibiotics , wrote the researchers.    
The researchers concluded that, although the study was limited in scope and length, deep brain stimulation ""may represent an 

effective, novel intervention for severely disabled patients with treatment-resistant depression.""    
The six patients who participated in the study showed severe depression according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. 

They had all failed to respond to at least four different treatments, including drugs, psychotherapy, and ECT.    
The researchers implanted the array of electrodes in a region called the ""subgenual cingulate region,"" which their earlier 

studies had indicated to be overactive in treatment-resistant depression.    
Precisely calibrated stimulation of a few volts produced immediate effects, the researchers wrote. ""All patients 

spontaneously reported acute effects including 'sudden calmness or lightness,' 'disappearance of the void,' sense of 

heightened awareness, increased interest, 'connectedness,' and sudden brightening of the room, including a description of the 

sharpening of visual details and intensification of colors in response to electrical stimulation,"" wrote the researchers. 

These effects were reversed when stimulation was turned off and returned when it was resumed.    
""Unexpectedly, with application of stimulation for progressively longer periods (from 1 to 3 hr), there was an increasing and 

correspondingly longer carry-over of the beneficial behavioral effects beyond cessation of the stimulation,"" reported the 

researchers.    
During the initial weeks of stimulation, ""Patients and their families described renewed interest and pleasure in social and 

family activities, decreased apathy and anhedonia, as well as an improved ability to plan, initiate, and complete tasks that 

were reported as impossible to attempt prior to surgery.""    
Analysis of brain activity using positron emission tomography revealed that the deep brain stimulation corrected abnormal 

hyperactivity in the subgenual cingulate region, which was correlated with abnormally decreased activity in the prefrontal 

cortex of the brain.    
Psychological testing showed that the surgery did not reduce cognitive function in the patients. In fact, patients showed 

significant improvement in hand-eye coordination, verbal fluency, and judgment of risk.    
Over a 6 month period of chronic stimulation, four of the patients continued to show significant antidepressant response, 

with three showing remission or near remission of illness, reported the researchers.

Recent immigration, lack of partner support and pregnancy-induced  hypertension  are significant factors in predicting 

whether women will experience depressive symptoms soon after giving birth, says a University of Toronto researcher.    
U of T nursing professor Cindy-Lee Dennis and colleagues at the University of British Columbia have developed a model that 

predicts which mothers are at high risk of developing depressive symptoms in the early postpartum period. Their study, 

published in the fall issue of Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavia, looked at almost 600 British Columbia mothers between April 

2001 and January 2002.    
Early detection is important, says Dennis, since low mood shortly after delivery is a reliable predictor of later developing 

 postpartum depression .    
\""Postpartum depression is a major public health issue that has significant consequences for the mother, child and family,\"" 

says Dennis. \""Fortunately, postpartum depression is amenable to supportive interventions early in the postpartum period. 

Previous studies have identified high-risk mothers at six to eight weeks after birth. Why wait until the mothers are 

depressed? Why not identify symptoms early so that so secondary preventive interventions can be initiated?\""    
Previous research has suggested that 13 per cent of new mothers suffer from postpartum depression. Such  depression  may 

incapacitate them, but it also has a negative impact on their babies. Children of depressed mothers may exhibit attachment 

insecurity, emotional developmental delay and difficulties with social interaction.    
The researchers identified a number of factors that make women vulnerable to depressive symptoms in the immediate postpartum 

period, including immigration during the five years prior to giving birth, pregnancy-induced hypertension, lack of partner 

support and lack of readiness for hospital discharge. The researchers also determined it is important to assess past 

depressive episodes, vulnerable personality traits, recent stressful life events, availability of support and maternal 

adjustment in identifying new mothers at risk for postpartum depression.    
\""The next step is to develop accessible and effective preventive and treatment plans for these women,\"" says Dennis.

Young women with a history of  depression  are twice as likely to have the metabolic syndrome, a cluster of symptoms that raise the risk of  heart disease , according to a new study.    
Men with a similar history do not suffer as frequently from the same symptoms, writes Leslie S. Kinder, Ph.D., of the Veterans? Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine.    
?Perhaps the health risks linked to depression are more critical to women,? Kinder says.    
Kinder and colleagues looked at results of a national health survey conducted between 1988 and 1994, covering more than 6,000 men and women ages 17 to 39. Women were more likely than men to have experienced a prior episode of depression, and those women who had had at least one episode were also more likely to suffer from the metabolic syndrome.    
People with the metabolic syndrome have at least three out of five factors linked to heart disease: high blood pressure; high triglycerides; low HDL (good) cholesterol; high fasting blood sugar; or abdominal  obesity .    
?Depression in women was associated with the number of the metabolic syndrome components present,? Kinder says, adding that the association between depression and  high blood pressure  was especially strong.    
The relationship held even when the researchers controlled for age, race, education, smoking, physical inactivity,  carbohydrate  consumption and alcohol use. Depression in men was not associated with the metabolic syndrome or its components, she says.    
Kinder notes that depressed people more often smoke, eat unhealthy diets, or lead a sedentary life. They also take their medications less often or otherwise fail to follow their doctors? advice. But that is unlikely to be the whole story, she says. Depression can cause the heart to speed up, and is also associated with poor regulation of the hormonal system and with changes in white blood cell count, blood platelets and other biological markers.    
?Failure to recognize and treat depression in patients with the metabolic syndrome may have deleterious physiological as well as psychological consequences,? she says.    
The survey could not determine whether the depression preceded development of the metabolic syndrome, although other research suggests that this could be the case.    
?Regardless of whether depression is a cause, consequence or simple marker for the metabolic syndrome, the association has important clinical ramifications,? Kinder says. ?Health care professionals should take special care to assess the psychological status of these patients and develop treatments that take into account the added difficulties patients with depression pose.?    
The researchers were supported by grants from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.
